        Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules

        These rules are effective as of September 25, 2020.

          This document is the ultimate authority for Magic: The Gathering® competitive game play. It consists of a
          series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and
          each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number. (Note that subrules skip the letters “l” and
          “o” due to potential confusion with the numbers “1” and “0”; subrule 704.5k is followed by 704.5m, then
          704.5n, then 704.5p, for example.)

      <h2 id="100">100. General</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>100.1. These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and
          multiplayer games.</p>
        <p>100.1a A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.</p>
        <p>100.1b A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section 8, “Multiplayer
          Rules.”</p>
        <p>100.2. To play, each player needs their own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any
          tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.</p>
        <p>100.2a In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each
          deck has a minimum deck size of 60 cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no
          more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.</p>
        <p>100.2b In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic
          product such as booster packs and creates their own deck using only this product and basic land cards), each
          deck has a minimum deck size of 40 cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are
          included with the product.</p>
        <p>100.2c Commander decks are subject to additional deckbuilding restrictions and requirements. See rule 903,
          “Commander,” for details.</p>

        <p>100.3. Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional
          Magic cards, and dice. See section 9, “Casual Variants.”</p>

        <p>100.4. Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to
          modify their deck between games of a match.</p>

        <p>100.4a In constructed play, a sideboard may contain no more than fifteen cards. The four-card limit (see rule
          100.2a) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.</p>

        <p>100.4b In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a player’s card pool not included in their
          deck are in that player’s sideboard.</p>

        <p>100.4c In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, all cards in a team’s card pool
          but not in either player’s deck are in that team’s sideboard.</p>

        <p>100.4d In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card in a team’s card pool but not in
          any player’s deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has their own sideboard;
          cards may not be transferred between players.</p>

        <p>100.5. If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum
          deck size. There is no maximum deck size for non-Commander decks.</p>

        <p>100.6. Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win
          prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at
          WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring
          all cards from some older sets.</p>

        <p>100.6a Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until
          one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.</p>

        <p>100.6b Players can use the Magic Store & Event Locator at Wizards.com/Locator to find tournaments in their
          area.</p>

        <p>100.7. Certain promotional cards and cards in the Unglued, Unhinged, and Unstable sets are printed with a
          silver border. These cards are intended for casual play and may have features and text that aren’t covered by
          these rules.</p>

        <p>
        <h2 id="101">101. The Magic Golden Rules</h2>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>101.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides
          only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the
          game at any time (see rule 104.3a).</p>

        <p>101.2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can’t
          happen, the “can’t” effect takes precedence.</p>
        <p>Example: If one effect reads “You may play an additional land this turn” and another reads “You can’t play
          lands this turn,” the effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.</p>

        <p>101.2a Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don’t fall under this rule. (See rule
          113.10.)</p>

        <p>101.3. Any part of an instruction that’s impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will
          specify consequences for this; if it doesn’t, there’s no effect.)</p>

        <p>101.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the
          player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player
          seated to the active player’s left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in
          turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player,
          Nonactive Player (APNAP) order” rule.</p>
        <p>Example: A card reads “Each player sacrifices a creature.” First, the active player chooses a creature they
          control. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses a creature they control. Then all
          creatures chosen this way are sacrificed simultaneously.</p>

        <p>101.4a If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as their hand or library, those
          cards may remain face down as they’re chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card
          they are choosing.</p>

        <p>101.4b A player knows the choices made by the previous players when making their choice, except as specified
          in 101.4a.</p>

        <p>101.4c If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the
          order specified. If no order is specified, the player chooses the order.</p>

        <p>101.4d If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player
          earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.</p>

        <p>101.4e If multiple players would make choices or take actions while starting the game, the starting player is
          considered the active player and each other player is considered a nonactive player.</p>

        <p>
        <h2 id="102">102. Players</h2>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other
          players are nonactive players.</p>

        <p>102.2. In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player.</p>

        <p>102.3. In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s teammates are the other players on their team, and the
          player’s opponents are all players not on their team.</p>

        <p>102.4. A spell or ability may use the term “your team” as shorthand for “you and/or your teammates.” In a
          game that isn’t a multiplayer game between teams, “your team” means the same thing as “you.”</p>

          103. Starting the Game
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>103.1. At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn.
          In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable
          method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous
          game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that
          game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The
          game’s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.</p>

        <p>103.1a In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.
        </p>

        <p>103.1b In an Archenemy game, these methods aren’t used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the
          archenemy takes the first turn.</p>

        <p>103.1c One card (Power Play) states that its controller is the starting player. This effect applies after
          this determination has happened and supersedes these methods.</p>

        <p>103.2. After the starting player has been determined, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are
          in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponents’ decks. The players’ decks become their
          libraries.</p>

        <p>103.2a If a player is using a sideboard (see rule 100.4) or cards being represented by substitute cards (see
          rule 713), those cards are set aside before shuffling.</p>

        <p>103.2b If a player wishes to reveal a card with a companion ability that they own from outside the game, they
          may do so after setting aside their sideboard. A player may reveal no more than one card this way, and they
          may do so only if their deck fulfills the condition of that card’s companion ability. (See rule 702.138,
          “Companion.”)</p>

        <p>103.2c In a Commander game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone
          after having the opportunity to reveal a card with a companion ability and before shuffling. See rule 903.6.
        </p>

        <p>103.2d In a Conspiracy Draft game, each player puts any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into
          the command zone before shuffling. See rule 905.4.</p>

        <p>103.3. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different
          starting life totals.</p>

        <p>103.3a In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team’s starting life total is 30.</p>

        <p>103.3b In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their
          vanguard card.</p>

        <p>103.3c In a Commander game, each player’s starting life total is 40.</p>

        <p>103.3d In a two-player Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each
          player’s starting life total is 30.</p>

        <p>103.3e In an Archenemy game, the archenemy’s starting life total is 40.</p>

        <p>103.4. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some
          effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may
          take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player
          in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take
          mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into
          their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards
          equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order.
          Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player’s opening hand, and that
          player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A
          player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further
          mulligans.</p>

        <p>103.4a In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting hand size is seven plus or minus the hand modifier of their
          vanguard card.</p>

        <p>103.4b If an effect allows a player to perform an action “any time [that player] could mulligan,” the player
          may perform that action at a time they would declare whether they will take a mulligan. This need not be in
          the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the
          player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, they then declare whether
          they will take a mulligan.</p>

        <p>103.4c In a multiplayer game and in any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward
          the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player
          may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>

        <p>103.4d In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team
          declares whether that player will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the
          same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A
          player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand.</p>

        <p>103.5. Some cards allow a player to take actions with them from their opening hand. Once the mulligan process
          (see rule 103.4) is complete, the starting player may take any such actions in any order. Then each other
          player in turn order may do the same.</p>

        <p>103.5a If a card allows a player to begin the game with that card on the battlefield, the player taking this
          action puts that card onto the battlefield.</p>

        <p>103.5b If a card allows a player to reveal it from their opening hand, the player taking this action does so.
          The card remains revealed until the first turn begins. Each card may be revealed this way only once.</p>

        <p>103.5c In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team, in
          whatever order that team likes, may take such actions. Teammates may consult while making their decisions.
          Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>103.6. In a Planechase game, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck
          and turns it face up. If it’s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck
          and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. The face-up plane card becomes the starting
          plane. (See rule 901, “Planechase.”)</p>

        <p>103.7. The starting player takes their first turn.</p>

        <p>103.7a In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule 504, “Draw Step”) of
          their first turn.</p>

        <p>103.7b In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn.</p>

        <p>103.7c In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of their first turn.</p>

          104. Ending the Game
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>104.1. A game ends immediately when a player wins, when the game is a draw, or when the game is restarted.
        </p>

        <p>104.2. There are several ways to win the game.</p>

        <p>104.2a A player still in the game wins the game if that player’s opponents have all left the game. This
          happens immediately and overrides all effects that would preclude that player from winning the game.</p>

        <p>104.2b An effect may state that a player wins the game.</p>

        <p>104.2c In a multiplayer game between teams, a team with at least one player still in the game wins the game
          if all other teams have left the game. Each player on the winning team wins the game, even if one or more of
          those players had previously lost that game.</p>

        <p>104.2d In an Emperor game, a team wins the game if its emperor wins the game. (See rule 809.5.)</p>

        <p>104.3. There are several ways to lose the game.</p>

        <p>104.3a A player can concede the game at any time. A player who concedes leaves the game immediately. That
          player loses the game.</p>

        <p>104.3b If a player’s life total is 0 or less, that player loses the game the next time a player would receive
          priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>104.3c If a player is required to draw more cards than are left in their library, they draw the remaining
          cards and then lose the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See
          rule 704.)</p>

        <p>104.3d If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game the next time a player would
          receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>104.3e An effect may state that a player loses the game.</p>

        <p>104.3f If a player would both win and lose the game simultaneously, that player loses the game.</p>

        <p>104.3g In a multiplayer game between teams, a team loses the game if all players on that team have lost the
          game.</p>

        <p>104.3h In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801), an effect that
          states that a player wins the game instead causes all of that player’s opponents within the player’s range of
          influence to lose the game. This may not cause the game to end.</p>

        <p>104.3i In an Emperor game, a team loses the game if its emperor loses the game. (See rule 809.5.)</p>

        <p>104.3j In a Commander game, a player that’s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over
          the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704. See also rule 903.10.)</p>

        <p>104.3k In a tournament, a player may lose the game as a result of a penalty given by a judge. See rule 100.6.
        </p>

        <p>104.4. There are several ways for the game to be a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4a If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4b If a game that’s not using the limited range of influence option (including a two-player game) somehow
          enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw.
          Loops that contain an optional action don’t result in a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4c An effect may state that the game is a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4d In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw if all remaining teams lose simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>104.4e In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, the effect of a spell or ability
          that states that the game is a draw causes the game to be a draw for that spell or ability’s controller and
          all players within their range of influence. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all
          other players.</p>

        <p>104.4f In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, if the game somehow enters a “loop”
          of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player
          who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence
          of any of those players. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all other players.</p>

        <p>104.4g In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for all
          remaining players on that team.</p>

        <p>104.4h In the Emperor variant, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor. (See rule
          809.5.)</p>

        <p>104.4i In a tournament, all players in the game may agree to an intentional draw. See rule 100.6.</p>

        <p>104.5. If a player loses the game, that player leaves the game. If the game is a draw for a player, that
          player leaves the game. The multiplayer rules handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see rule
          800.4.</p>

        <p>104.6. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. All players still in the game when it restarts then
          immediately begin a new game. See rule 719, “Restarting the Game.”</p>

        <h2 id="105">
          105. Colors
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>105.1. There are five colors in the Magic game: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>

        <p>105.2. An object can be one or more of the five colors, or it can be no color at all. An object is the color
          or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame. An object’s color or
          colors may also be defined by a color indicator or a characteristic-defining ability. See rule 202.2.</p>

        <p>105.2a A monocolored object is exactly one of the five colors.</p>

        <p>105.2b A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors.</p>

        <p>105.2c A colorless object has no color.</p>

        <p>105.3. Effects may change an object’s color or give a color to a colorless object. If an effect gives an
          object a new color, the new color replaces all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the
          object became that color “in addition” to its other colors). Effects may also make a colored object become
          colorless.</p>

        <p>105.4. If a player is asked to choose a color, they must choose one of the five colors. “Multicolored” is not
          a color. Neither is “colorless.”</p>

        <p>105.5. If an effect refers to a color pair, it means exactly two of the five colors. There are ten color
          pairs: white and blue, white and black, blue and black, blue and red, black and red, black and green, red and
          green, red and white, green and white, and green and blue.</p>

        <h2 id="106">
          106. Mana
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>106.1. Mana is the primary resource in the game. Players spend mana to pay costs, usually when casting spells
          and activating abilities.</p>

        <p>106.1a There are five colors of mana: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>

        <p>106.1b There are six types of mana: 
          <li>white,</li> <li>blue,</li> <li>black,</li> <li>red,</li> <li>green,</li> and <li>colorless.</li></p>

        <p>106.2. Mana is represented by mana symbols (see rule 107.4). Mana symbols also represent mana costs (see rule
          202).</p>

        <p>106.3. Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule 605). It may also be produced by the
          effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that aren’t mana abilities. A spell or ability that
          produces mana instructs a player to add that mana.</p>

        <p>106.4. When an effect instructs a player to add mana, that mana goes into a player’s mana pool. From there,
          it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the player’s mana pool as unspent mana. Each
          player’s mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase, and the player is said to lose this mana. Cards
          with abilities that produce mana or refer to unspent mana have received errata in the Oracle™ card reference
          to no longer explicitly refer to the mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.4a If any mana remains in a player’s mana pool after mana is spent to pay a cost, that player announces
          what mana is still there.</p>

        <p>106.4b If a player passes priority (see rule 117) while there is mana in their mana pool, that player
          announces what mana is there.</p>

        <p>106.5. If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.</p>
        <p>Example: Meteor Crater has the ability “{T}: Choose a color of a permanent you control. Add one mana of that
          color.” If you control no colored permanents, activating Meteor Crater’s mana ability produces no mana.</p>

        <p>106.6. Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, have an additional
          effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on, or create a delayed triggered ability (see
          rule 603.7a) that triggers when that mana is spent. This doesn’t affect the mana’s type.</p>
        <p>Example: A player’s mana pool contains {R}{G} which can be spent only to cast creature spells. That player
          activates Doubling Cube’s ability, which reads “{3}, {T}: Double the amount of each type of unspent mana you
          have.” The player’s mana pool now has {R}{R}{G}{G} in it, {R}{G} of which can be spent on anything.</p>

        <p>106.6a Some replacement effects increase the amount of mana produced by a spell or ability. In these cases,
          any restrictions or additional effects created by the spell or ability will apply to all mana produced. If the
          spell or ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the mana is spent, a separate delayed
          triggered ability is created for each mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a continuous effect or
          replacement effect if the mana is spent, a separate effect is created once for each mana produced.</p>

        <p>106.7. Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents “could produce.”
          The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that
          permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable
          replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid.
          If that permanent wouldn’t produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this
          way, there’s no type of mana it could produce.</p>
        <p>Example: Exotic Orchard has the ability “{T}: Add one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls
          could produce.” If your opponent controls no lands, activating Exotic Orchard’s mana ability will produce no
          mana. The same is true if you and your opponent each control no lands other than Exotic Orchards. However, if
          you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard, then each Exotic
          Orchard could produce {G}.</p>

        <p>106.8. If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that player
          chooses one half of that symbol. If a colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that player’s
          mana pool. If a generic half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana represented by that half’s number is added
          to that player’s mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.9. If an effect would add mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, one mana
          of the color of that symbol is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.10. If an effect would add mana represented by a generic mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that much
          colorless mana is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.11. If an effect would add mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols to a player’s mana pool,
          that much colorless mana is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.12. To “tap [a permanent] for mana” is to activate a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T}
          symbol in its activation cost. See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”</p>

        <p>106.12a An ability that triggers whenever a permanent “is tapped for mana” or is tapped for mana of a
          specified type triggers whenever such a mana ability resolves and produces mana or the specified type of mana.
        </p>

        <p>106.12b A replacement effect that applies if a permanent “is tapped for mana” or tapped for mana of a
          specific type and/or amount modifies the mana production event while such an ability is resolving and
          producing mana or the specified type and/or amount of mana.</p>

        <p>106.13. One card (Drain Power) causes one player to lose unspent mana and another to add “the mana lost this
          way.” (Note that these may be the same player.) This empties the former player’s mana pool and causes the mana
          emptied this way to be put into the latter player’s mana pool. Which permanents, spells, and/or abilities
          produced that mana are unchanged, as are any restrictions or additional effects associated with any of that
          mana.</p>

        <h2 id="107">
          107. Numbers and Symbols
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>107.1. The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.</p>

        <p>107.1a You can’t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a
          spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or
          down.</p>

        <p>107.1b Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can’t choose a negative
          number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, it’s possible for a game value, such as
          a creature’s power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it
          does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used
          instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a player’s life total or the power and/or
          toughness of a creature or creature card.</p>
        <p>Example: If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, it’s a -2/4 creature. It doesn’t assign damage in combat. Its total
          power and toughness is 2. Giving it +3/+0 would raise its power to 1.</p>
        <p>Example: Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature with the ability “{T}: Add an amount of {G} equal to Viridian
          Joiner’s power.” An effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated. The ability adds no mana to your
          mana pool.</p>
        <p>Example: Chameleon Colossus is a 4/4 creature with the ability “{2}{G}{G}: Chameleon Colossus gets +X/+X
          until end of turn, where X is its power.” An effect gives it -6/-0, then its ability is activated. It remains
          a -2/4 creature. It doesn’t become -4/2.</p>

        <p>107.1c If a rule or ability instructs a player to choose “any number,” that player may choose any positive
          number or zero.</p>

        <p>107.2. If anything needs to use a number that can’t be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it
          uses 0 instead.</p>

        <p>107.3. Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects
          have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.</p>

        <p>107.3a If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation
          cost with an {X}, [-X], or X in it, and the value of X isn’t defined by the text of that spell or ability, the
          controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X as part of casting the spell or
          activating the ability. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana
          cost or in any alternative cost or additional cost it has equals the announced value. While an activated
          ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.</p>

        <p>107.3b If a player is casting a spell that has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of X isn’t defined by the
          text of that spell, and an effect lets that player cast that spell while paying neither its mana cost nor an
          alternative cost that includes X, then the only legal choice for X is 0. This doesn’t apply to effects that
          only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”</p>

        <p>107.3c If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X
          is defined by the text of that spell or ability, then that’s the value of X while that spell or ability is on
          the stack. The controller of that spell or ability doesn’t get to choose the value. Note that the value of X
          may change while that spell or ability is on the stack.</p>

        <p>107.3d If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X
          in it, the value of X is chosen by the player taking the special action immediately before they pay that cost.
        </p>

        <p>107.3e If a spell or ability refers to the {X} or X in the mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or
          activation cost of another object, any X in that spell or ability’s text uses the value of X chosen or defined
          for the other object.</p>

        <p>107.3f Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a mana cost, alternative cost,
          additional cost, or activation cost. If the value of X isn’t defined, the controller of the spell or ability
          chooses the value of X at the appropriate time (either as it’s put on the stack or as it resolves).</p>

        <p>107.3g If a card in any zone other than the stack has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of {X} is treated as
          0, even if the value of X is defined somewhere within its text.</p>

        <p>107.3h If an effect instructs a player to pay an object’s mana cost that includes {X}, the value of X is
          treated as 0 unless the object is a spell on the stack. In that case, the value of X is the value chosen or
          determined for it as the spell was cast.</p>

        <p>107.3i Normally, all instances of X on an object have the same value at any given time.</p>

        <p>107.3j If an object gains an ability, the value of X within that ability is the value defined by that
          ability, or 0 if that ability doesn’t define a value of X. This is an exception to rule 107.3i. This may occur
          with ability-adding effects, text-changing effects, or copy effects.</p>

        <p>107.3k If an object’s activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its activation cost, the value of X for
          that ability is independent of any other values of X chosen for that object or for other instances of
          abilities of that object. This is an exception to rule 107.3i.</p>

        <p>107.3m If an object’s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability or replacement effect refers to X, and the
          spell that became that object as it resolved had a value of X chosen for any of its costs, the value of X for
          that ability is the same as the value of X for that spell, although the value of X for that permanent is 0.
          This is an exception to rule 107.3i.</p>

        <p>107.3n Some objects use the letter Y in addition to the letter X. Y follows the same rules as X.</p>

        <p>107.4. The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {C}; the numerical symbols {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4},
          and so on; the variable symbol {X}; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W},
          {G/W}, and {G/U}; the monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, and {2/G}; the Phyrexian mana
          symbols {W/P}, {U/P}, {B/P}, {R/P}, and {G/P}; and the snow symbol {S}.</p>

        <p>107.4a There are five primary colored mana symbols: {W} is white, {U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G}
          green. These symbols are used to represent colored mana, and also to represent colored mana in costs. Colored
          mana in costs can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. See rule 202, “Mana Cost and Color.”</p>

        <p>107.4b Numerical symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X}) represent generic mana in costs.
          Generic mana in costs can be paid with any type of mana. For more information about {X}, see rule 107.3.</p>

        <p>107.4c The colorless mana symbol {C} is used to represent one colorless mana, and also to represent a cost
          that can be paid only with one colorless mana.</p>

        <p>107.4d The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder for a cost that can be paid with no
          resources. (See rule 118.5.)</p>

        <p>107.4e Hybrid mana symbols are also colored mana symbols. Each one represents a cost that can be paid in one
          of two ways, as represented by the two halves of the symbol. A hybrid symbol such as {W/U} can be paid with
          either white or blue mana, and a monocolored hybrid symbol such as {2/B} can be paid with either one black
          mana or two mana of any type. A hybrid mana symbol is all of its component colors.</p>
        <p>Example: {G/W}{G/W} can be paid by spending {G}{G}, {G}{W}, or {W}{W}.</p>

        <p>107.4f Phyrexian mana symbols are colored mana symbols: {W/P} is white, {U/P} is blue, {B/P} is black, {R/P}
          is red, and {G/P} is green. A Phyrexian mana symbol represents a cost that can be paid either with one mana of
          its color or by paying 2 life.</p>
        <p>Example: {W/P}{W/P} can be paid by spending {W}{W}, by spending {W} and paying 2 life, or by paying 4 life.
        </p>

        <p>107.4g In rules text, the Phyrexian symbol {P} with no colored background means any of the five Phyrexian
          mana symbols.</p>

        <p>107.4h The snow mana symbol {S} represents one mana in a cost. This mana can be paid with one mana of any
          type produced by a snow permanent (see rule 205.4g). Effects that reduce the amount of generic mana you pay
          don’t affect {S} costs. Snow is neither a color nor a type of mana.</p>

        <p>107.5. The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means “Tap this permanent.” A permanent
          that’s already tapped can’t be tapped again to pay the cost. A creature’s activated ability with the tap
          symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control
          continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.</p>

        <p>107.6. The untap symbol is {Q}. The untap symbol in an activation cost means “Untap this permanent.” A
          permanent that’s already untapped can’t be untapped again to pay the cost. A creature’s activated ability with
          the untap symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s
          control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.</p>

        <p>107.7. Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost. Positive loyalty symbols
          point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature
          a minus sign followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols don’t point in either direction and feature
          a 0. [+N] means “Put N loyalty counters on this permanent,” [-N] means “Remove N loyalty counters from this
          permanent,” and [0] means “Put zero loyalty counters on this permanent.”</p>

        <p>107.8. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that
          represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as “N1-N2,”
          or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “N3+.” Any abilities printed within the same
          text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness
          box printed within that striation, indicated here as “[P/T].” See rule 710, “Leveler Cards.”</p>

        <p>107.8a “{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on
          it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”</p>

        <p>107.8b “{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it,
          it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”</p>

        <p>107.9. A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odyssey™ block cards with abilities that are
          relevant in a player’s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they’re in a
          graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>107.10. A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the Future Sight® set printed with an
          alternate “timeshifted” frame. If the card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks
          for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise for enchantment, a chalice for
          artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for land. If the card has multiple card types, that’s indicated by a
          black and white cross. This icon has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>107.11. The Planeswalker symbol is {PW}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase
          casual variant. See rule 901, “Planechase.”</p>

        <p>107.12. The chaos symbol is {CHAOS}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual
          variant, as well as in abilities that refer to the results of rolling the planar die. See rule 901,
          “Planechase.”</p>

        <p>107.13. A color indicator is a circular symbol that appears to the left of the type line on some cards. The
          color of the symbol defines the card’s color or colors. See rule 202, “Mana Cost and Color.”</p>

        <p>107.14. The energy symbol is {E}. It represents one energy counter. To pay {E}, a player removes one energy
          counter from themselves.</p>

        <p>107.15. The text box of a Saga card contains chapter symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that
          represents a triggered ability. A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as “rN”. The text
          printed in the text box striation to the right of a chapter symbol is the effect of the triggered ability it
          represents. See rule 714, “Saga Cards.”</p>

        <p>107.15a “{rN}—[Effect]” means “When one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore
          counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].”</p>

        <p>107.15b “{rN1}, {rN2}—[Effect]” is the same as “{rN1}—[Effect]” and “{rN2}—[Effect].”</p>

        <h2 id="108">
          108. Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>108.1. Use the Oracle card reference when determining a card’s wording. A card’s Oracle text can be found
          using the Gatherer card database at Gatherer.Wizards.com.</p>

        <p>108.2. When a rule or text on a card refers to a “card,” it means only a Magic card or an object represented
          by a Magic card.</p>

        <p>108.2a Most Magic games use only traditional Magic cards, which measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by
          3.5 inches (8.8 cm). Certain formats also use nontraditional Magic cards, oversized cards that may have
          different backs.</p>

        <p>108.2b Tokens aren’t considered cards—even a card-sized game supplement that represents a token isn’t
          considered a card for rules purposes.</p>

        <p>108.3. The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. If a card is
          brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a player’s deck, its owner is the player
          who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put
          it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game
          rules except for the rules for ante. (See rule 407.)</p>

        <p>108.3a In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be
          the owner of all cards in the planar deck. See rule 901.6.</p>

        <p>108.3b Some spells and abilities allow a player to take cards they own from outside the game and bring them
          into the game. (See rule 400.11b.) If a card outside that game is involved in a Magic game, its owner is
          determined as described in rule 108.3. If a card outside that game is in the sideboard of a Magic game (see
          rule 100.4), its owner is considered to be the player who started the game with it in their sideboard. In all
          other cases, the owner of a card outside the game is its legal owner.</p>

        <p>108.4. A card doesn’t have a controller unless that card represents a permanent or spell; in those cases, its
          controller is determined by the rules for permanents or spells. See rules 110.2 and 112.2.</p>

        <p>108.4a If anything asks for the controller of a card that doesn’t have one (because it’s not a permanent or
          spell), use its owner instead.</p>

        <p>108.5. Nontraditional Magic cards can’t start the game in any zone other than the command zone (see rule
          408). If an effect would bring a nontraditional Magic card into the game from outside the game, it doesn’t;
          that card remains outside the game.</p>

        <p>108.6. For more information about cards, see section 2, “Parts of a Card.”</p>

        <h2 id="109">
          109. Objects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>109.1. An object is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, a permanent, or an
          emblem.</p>

        <p>109.2. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but
          doesn’t include the word “card,” “spell,” “source,” or “scheme,” it means a permanent of that card type or
          subtype on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>109.2a If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “card” and the name of a
          zone, it means a card matching that description in the stated zone.</p>

        <p>109.2b If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “spell,” it means a spell
          matching that description on the stack.</p>

        <p>109.2c If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “source,” it means a
          source matching that description—either a source of an ability or a source of damage—in any zone. See rule
          609.7.</p>

        <p>109.2d If an ability of a scheme card includes the text “this scheme,” it means the scheme card in the
          command zone on which that ability is printed.</p>

        <p>109.3. An object’s characteristics are name, mana cost, color, color indicator, card type, subtype,
          supertype, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can
          have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn’t a characteristic. For
          example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell’s target, an object’s owner or
          controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.</p>

        <p>109.4. Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the
          stack nor on the battlefield aren’t controlled by any player. See rule 108.4. There are six exceptions to this
          rule:</p>

        <p>109.4a The controller of a mana ability is determined as though it were on the stack. See rule 605, “Mana
          Abilities.”</p>

        <p>109.4b An emblem is controlled by the player that puts it into the command zone. See rule 114, “Emblems.”</p>

        <p>109.4c In a Planechase game, a face-up plane or phenomenon card is controlled by the player designated as the
          planar controller. This is usually the active player. See rule 901.6.</p>

        <p>109.4d In a Vanguard game, each vanguard card is controlled by its owner. See rule 902.6.</p>

        <p>109.4e In an Archenemy game, each scheme card is controlled by its owner. See rule 904.7.</p>

        <p>109.4f In a Conspiracy Draft game, each conspiracy card is controlled by its owner. See rule 905.5.</p>

        <p>109.5. The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s controller, its would-be controller (if
          a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static
          ability, this is the current controller of the object it’s on. For an activated ability, this is the player
          who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability
          triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered
          ability, see rules 603.7d–f.</p>

        <h2 id="110">
          110. Permanents
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>110.1. A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield
          indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent
          as it’s moved to another zone by an effect or rule.</p>

        <p>110.2. A permanent’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless it’s a token; see
          rule 111.2). A permanent’s controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the
          battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.</p>

        <p>110.2a If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the battlefield, that object enters the
          battlefield under that player’s control unless the effect states otherwise.</p>

        <p>110.2b If an effect causes a player to gain control of another player’s permanent spell, the first player
          controls the permanent that spell becomes, but the permanent’s controller by default is the player who put
          that spell onto the stack. (This distinction is relevant in multiplayer games; see rule 800.4c.)</p>

        <p>110.3. A nontoken permanent’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any
          continuous effects. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>

        <p>110.4. There are five permanent types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and
          sorcery cards can’t enter the battlefield and thus can’t be permanents. Some tribal cards can enter the
          battlefield and some can’t, depending on their other card types. See section 3, “Card Types.”</p>

        <p>110.4a The term “permanent card” is used to refer to a card that could be put onto the battlefield.
          Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.</p>

        <p>110.4b The term “permanent spell” is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent
          as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.
        </p>

        <p>110.4c If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on the battlefield. It’s still a
          permanent.</p>

        <p>110.5. A permanent’s status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two
          possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each
          permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.</p>

        <p>110.5a Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics.</p>

        <p>110.5b Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and phased in unless a spell or ability
          says otherwise.</p>

        <p>110.5c A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or turn-based action changes it, even if that
          status is not relevant to it.</p>
        <p>Example: Dimir Doppelganger says “{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger
          becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip card.
          Through use of Jushi Apprentice’s ability, this creature flips, making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with
          the Dimir Doppelganger ability. If this permanent then becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear, it will retain its
          flipped status even though that has no relevance to Runeclaw Bear. If its copy ability is activated again,
          this time targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanent’s flipped status means it will
          have the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with the Dimir
          Doppelganger ability.</p>

        <p>110.5d Only permanents have status. Cards not on the battlefield do not. Although an exiled card may be face
          down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent. Similarly, cards not on the battlefield
          are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.</p>

          111. Tokens
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>111.1. Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that
          isn’t represented by a card.</p>

        <p>111.2. The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters the battlefield under that player’s
          control.</p>

        <p>111.3. The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for
          the token. This becomes the token’s “text.” The characteristic values defined this way are functionally
          equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the token’s
          copiable values. A token doesn’t have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Jade Mage has the ability “{2}{G}: Create a 1/1 green Saproling creature token.” The resulting token
          has no mana cost, supertypes, rules text, or abilities.</p>

        <p>111.4. A spell or ability that creates a token sets both its name and its subtype(s). If the spell or ability
          doesn’t specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its subtype(s). A “Goblin Scout creature
          token,” for example, is named “Goblin Scout” and has the creature subtypes Goblin and Scout. Once a token is
          on the battlefield, changing its name doesn’t change its subtype, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>111.5. If a spell or ability would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or
          more of that token’s characteristics can’t enter the battlefield, the token is not created.</p>

        <p>111.6. A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token’s card
          type or subtype. A token isn’t a card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a
          Magic booster pack).</p>

        <p>111.7. A token that’s in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see
          rule 704. (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token
          ceases to exist.)</p>

        <p>111.8. A token that has left the battlefield can’t move to another zone or come back onto the battlefield. If
          such a token would change zones, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time
          state-based actions are checked; see rule 704.</p>

        <p>111.9. Some effects instruct a player to create a legendary token. These may be written “create [name], a . .
          .” and list characteristics for the token. This is the same as an instruction to create a token with the
          listed characteristics that has the given name.</p>

        <p>111.10. Some effects instruct a player to create a predefined token. These effects use the definition below
          to determine the characteristics the token is created with. The effect that creates a predefined token may
          also modify or add to the predefined characteristics.</p>

        <p>111.10a A Treasure token is a colorless Treasure artifact token with “{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one
          mana of any color.”</p>

        <p>111.10b A Food token is a colorless Food artifact token with “{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: You gain 3
          life.”</p>

        <p>111.10c A Gold token is a colorless Gold artifact token with “Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any
          color.”</p>

        <p>111.11. A copy of a permanent spell becomes a token as it resolves. The token has the characteristics of the
          spell that became that token. The token is not “created” for the purposes of any replacement effects or
          triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.</p>

        <h2 id="112">
          112. Spells
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>112.1. A spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast (see rule 601, “Casting Spells”), the
          card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its
          owner’s hand. (See rule 405, “Stack.”) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule
          608, “Resolving Spells and Abilities”), is countered (see rule 701.5), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more
          information, see section 6, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”</p>

        <p>112.1a A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. See rule 706.10.</p>

        <p>112.1b Some effects allow a player to cast a copy of a card; if the player does, that copy is a spell as
          well. See rule 706.12.</p>

        <p>112.2. A spell’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless it’s a copy. In that
          case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spell’s controller
          is, by default, the player who put it on the stack. Every spell has a controller.</p>

        <p>112.3. A noncopy spell’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any
          continuous effects. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>

        <p>112.4. If an effect changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the
          permanent when the spell resolves. See rule 400.7.</p>
        <p>Example: If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the creature is white when it enters the
          battlefield and remains white for the duration of the effect changing its color.</p>

        <h2 id="113">
          113. Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>113.1. An ability can be one of three things:</p>

        <p>113.1a An ability can be a characteristic an object has that lets it affect the game. An object’s abilities
          are defined by its rules text or by the effect that created it. Abilities can also be granted to objects by
          rules or effects. (Effects that grant abilities usually use the words “has,” “have,” “gains,” or “gain.”)
          Abilities generate effects. (See rule 609, “Effects.”)</p>

        <p>113.1b An ability can be something that a player has that changes how the game affects the player. A player
          normally has no abilities unless granted to that player by effects.</p>

        <p>113.1c An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. This kind of ability is an object.
          (See section 6, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”)</p>

        <p>113.2. Abilities can affect the objects they’re on. They can also affect other objects and/or players.</p>

        <p>113.2a Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental.</p>
        <p>Example: “[This creature] can’t block” is an ability.</p>

        <p>113.2b An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability of the card.</p>

        <p>113.2c An object may have multiple abilities. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain
          defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule 702, “Keyword Abilities”), each
          paragraph break in a card’s text marks a separate ability. If the object is not represented by a card, the
          effect that created it may have given it multiple abilities. An object may also be granted additional
          abilities by a spell or ability. If an object has multiple instances of the same ability, each instance
          functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the
          specific ability for more information.</p>

        <p>113.2d Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement
          effects or prevention effects. See rule 609, “Effects.”</p>

        <p>113.3. There are four general categories of abilities:</p>

        <p>113.3a Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions while an instant or sorcery spell is
          resolving. Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it’s an activated ability, a
          triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule 113.6.</p>

        <p>113.3b Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation
          instructions (if any).]” A player may activate such an ability whenever they have priority. Doing so puts it
          on the stack, where it remains until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule
          602, “Activating Activated Abilities.”</p>

        <p>113.3c Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[Trigger condition],
          [effect],” and include (and usually begin with) the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” Whenever the trigger
          event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there
          until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule 603, “Handling Triggered
          Abilities.”</p>

        <p>113.3d Static abilities are written as statements. They’re simply true. Static abilities create continuous
          effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or
          while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule 604, “Handling Static Abilities.”</p>

        <p>113.4. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow
          special rules: They don’t use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana
          abilities even if they don’t have priority. See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”</p>

        <p>113.5. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may
          activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty
          during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that
          permanent that turn. See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”</p>

        <p>113.6. Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack.
          Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions
          are as follows:</p>

        <p>113.6a Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside the game. (See rule 604.3.)</p>

        <p>113.6b An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.</p>

        <p>113.6c An object’s ability that allows a player to pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost or
          otherwise modifies what that particular object costs to cast functions on the stack.</p>

        <p>113.6d An object’s ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast
          functions in any zone from which it could be played or cast and also on the stack. An object’s ability that
          grants it another ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast
          functions only on the stack.</p>

        <p>113.6e An object’s ability that restricts or modifies what zones that particular object can be played or cast
          from functions everywhere, even outside the game.</p>

        <p>113.6f An object’s ability that states it can’t be countered functions on the stack.</p>

        <p>113.6g An object’s ability that modifies how that particular object enters the battlefield functions as that
          object is entering the battlefield. See rule 614.12.</p>

        <p>113.6h An object’s ability that states counters can’t be put on that object functions as that object is
          entering the battlefield in addition to functioning while that object is on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>113.6i An object’s activated ability that has a cost that can’t be paid while the object is on the
          battlefield functions from any zone in which its cost can be paid.</p>

        <p>113.6j A trigger condition that can’t trigger from the battlefield functions in all zones it can trigger
          from. Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.</p>
        <p>Example: Absolver Thrull has the ability “When Absolver Thrull enters the battlefield or the creature it
          haunts dies, destroy target enchantment.” The first trigger condition functions from the battlefield and the
          second trigger condition functions from the exile zone. (See rule 702.54, “Haunt.”)</p>

        <p>113.6k An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it’s on out of a particular zone
          functions only in that zone, unless its trigger condition or a previous part of its cost or effect specifies
          that the object is put into that zone or, if the object is an Aura, that the object it enchants leaves the
          battlefield. The same is true if the effect of that ability creates a delayed triggered ability whose effect
          moves the object out of a particular zone.</p>
        <p>Example: Reassembling Skeleton says “{1}{B}: Return Reassembling Skeleton from your graveyard to the
          battlefield tapped.” A player may activate this ability only if Reassembling Skeleton is in their graveyard.
        </p>

        <p>113.6m An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions before the game begins. Such an
          ability modifies not just the Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules and any
          other documents that set the deck construction rules for a specific format. However, such an ability can’t
          affect the format legality of a card, including whether it’s banned or restricted. The current Magic: The
          Gathering Tournament Rules can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.</p>

        <p>113.6n Abilities of emblems, plane cards, vanguard cards, scheme cards, and conspiracy cards function in the
          command zone. See rule 114, “Emblems”; rule 901, “Planechase”; rule 902, “Vanguard”; rule 904, “Archenemy”;
          and rule 905, “Conspiracy Draft.”</p>

        <p>113.7. The source of an ability is the object that generated it. The source of an activated ability on the
          stack is the object whose ability was activated. The source of a triggered ability (other than a delayed
          triggered ability) on the stack, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put on the stack, is the
          object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
        </p>

        <p>113.7a Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction
          or removal of the source after that time won’t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to
          do something (for example, “Prodigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any target”) rather than the ability doing
          anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the
          source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that
          information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it
          resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at that time, its
          last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.</p>

        <p>113.8. The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of
          a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the
          ability’s source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the ability’s source
          when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.</p>

        <p>113.9. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren’t spells, and therefore can’t be countered by
          anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects
          that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities don’t use the stack and thus can’t be countered at all.
        </p>

        <p>113.10. Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the
          object “gains” or “has” that ability, or similar. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object
          “loses” that ability.</p>

        <p>113.10a An effect that adds an activated ability may include activation instructions for that ability. These
          instructions become part of the ability that’s added to the object.</p>

        <p>113.10b Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.</p>

        <p>113.10c If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails. See
          rule 613 for more information about the interaction of continuous effects.</p>

        <p>113.11. Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object “can’t
          have” that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. It’s also impossible for an effect to add
          that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the
          specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts
          of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other
          continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability won’t
          apply to that object.</p>

        <p>113.12. An effect that sets an object’s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is
          different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object “gains” or “has” an ability, that ability can
          be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (“[permanent] is
          [characteristic value]”), it’s not granting an ability. (See rule 604.3.) Similarly, if an effect states a
          quality of that object (“[creature] can’t be blocked,” for example), it’s neither granting an ability nor
          setting a characteristic.</p>
        <p>Example: Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, “Creatures with no abilities get +2/+2.” A Runeclaw Bear (a creature
          with no abilities) enchanted by an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” would not get +2/+2. A
          Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says “Enchanted creature is red” or “Enchanted creature can’t be
          blocked” would get +2/+2.</p>

        <h2 id="114">
          114. Emblems
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>114.1. Some effects put emblems into the command zone. An emblem is a marker used to represent an object that
          has one or more abilities, but no other characteristics.</p>

        <p>114.2. An effect that creates an emblem is written “[Player] gets an emblem with [ability].” This means that
          [player] puts an emblem with [ability] into the command zone. The emblem is both owned and controlled by that
          player.</p>

        <p>114.3. An emblem has no characteristics other than the abilities defined by the effect that created it. In
          particular, an emblem has no name, no types, no mana cost, and no color.</p>

        <p>114.4. Abilities of emblems function in the command zone.</p>

        <p>114.5. An emblem is neither a card nor a permanent. Emblem isn’t a card type.</p>

        <h2 id="115">
          115. Targets
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>115.1. Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets
          are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the
          process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets can’t be changed except by another spell or
          ability that explicitly says it can do so.</p>

        <p>115.1a An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability identifies something it will affect by
          using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or
          player. The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule 601.2c. (If an activated or triggered ability
          of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not.)</p>
        <p>Example: A sorcery card has the ability “When you cycle this card, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of
          turn.” This triggered ability is targeted, but that doesn’t make the card it’s on targeted.</p>

        <p>115.1b Aura spells are always targeted. An Aura’s target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see
          rule 702.5, “Enchant”). The target is chosen as the spell is cast; see rule 601.2c. An Aura permanent doesn’t
          target anything; only the spell is targeted. (An activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can also
          be targeted.)</p>

        <p>115.1c An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target
          [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are
          chosen as the ability is activated; see rule 602.2b.</p>

        <p>115.1d A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target
          [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are
          chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see rule 603.3d.</p>

        <p>115.1e Some keyword abilities, such as equip and modular, represent targeted activated or triggered
          abilities, and some keyword abilities, such as mutate, cause spells to have targets. In those cases, the
          phrase “target [something]” appears in the rule for that keyword ability rather than in the ability itself.
          (The keyword’s reminder text will often contain the word “target.”) See rule 702, “Keyword Abilities.”</p>

        <p>115.2. Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies
          that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or (b) targets an object that can’t exist on the
          battlefield, such as a spell or ability. See also rule 115.4.</p>

        <p>115.3. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on a spell or
          ability. If the spell or ability uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be
          chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). This rule
          applies both when choosing targets for a spell or ability and when changing targets or choosing new targets
          for a spell or ability (see rule 115.7).</p>

        <p>115.4. Some spells and abilities that refer to damage require “any target,” “another target,” “two targets,”
          or similar rather than “target [something].” These targets may be creatures, players, or planeswalkers. Other
          game objects, such as noncreature artifacts or spells, can’t be chosen.</p>

        <p>115.5. A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.</p>

        <p>115.6. A spell or ability that requires targets may allow zero targets to be chosen. Such a spell or ability
          is still said to require targets, but that spell or ability is targeted only if one or more targets have been
          chosen for it.</p>

        <p>115.7. Some effects allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, and other effects allow a
          player to choose new targets for a spell or ability.</p>

        <p>115.7a If an effect allows a player to “change the target(s)” of a spell or ability, each target can be
          changed only to another legal target. If a target can’t be changed to another legal target, the original
          target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by then. If all the targets aren’t changed
          to other legal targets, none of them are changed.</p>

        <p>115.7b If an effect allows a player to “change a target” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule
          115.7a is followed, except that only one of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of
          them).</p>

        <p>115.7c If an effect allows a player to “change any targets” of a spell or ability, the process described in
          rule 115.7a is followed, except that any number of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or
          none of them).</p>

        <p>115.7d If an effect allows a player to “choose new targets” for a spell or ability, the player may leave any
          number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some
          or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal and must not cause any unchanged targets to become
          illegal.</p>

        <p>115.7e When changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability, only the final set of targets is
          evaluated to determine whether the change is legal.</p>
        <p>Example: Arc Trail is a sorcery that reads “Arc Trail deals 2 damage to any target and 1 damage to another
          target.” The current targets of Arc Trail are Runeclaw Bear and Llanowar Elves, in that order. You cast
          Redirect, an instant that reads “You may choose new targets for target spell,” targeting Arc Trail. You can
          change the first target to Llanowar Elves and change the second target to Runeclaw Bear.</p>

        <p>115.7f A spell or ability may “divide” or “distribute” an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or
          more targets. When changing targets or choosing new targets for that spell or ability, the original division
          can’t be changed.</p>

        <p>115.8. Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that
          allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal
          spell or ability, doesn’t allow that player to change its mode. (See rule 700.2.)</p>

        <p>115.9. Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may
          check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.</p>

        <p>115.9a An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] with a single target” checks the number of times any
          object or player was chosen as the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the
          number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object or player became a target more than once,
          each of those instances is counted separately.</p>

        <p>115.9b An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets [something]” checks the current state of
          that spell or ability’s targets. If an object it targets is still in the zone it’s expected to be in or a
          player it targets is still in the game, that target’s current information is used, even if it’s not currently
          legal for that spell or ability. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in or a
          player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used.
        </p>

        <p>115.9c An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets only [something]” checks the number of
          different objects or players that were chosen as targets of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack
          (as modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those objects or players that are
          currently legal targets. If that number is one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player
          multiple times), the current state of that spell or ability’s target is checked as described in rule 115.9b.
        </p>

        <p>115.10. Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they don’t target. In general, those objects and
          players aren’t chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule 608, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”</p>

        <p>115.10a Just because an object or player is being affected by a spell or ability doesn’t make that object or
          player a target of that spell or ability. Unless that object or player is identified by the word “target” in
          the text of that spell or ability, or the rule for that keyword ability, it’s not a target.</p>

        <p>115.10b In particular, the word “you” in an object’s text doesn’t indicate a target.</p>

          116. Special Actions
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>116.1. Special actions are actions a player may take when they have priority that don’t use the stack. These
          are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates
          automatically. (See rule 703, “Turn-Based Actions,” and rule 704, “State-Based Actions.”)</p>

        <p>116.2. There are nine special actions:</p>

        <p>116.2a Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from
          the zone it was in (usually that player’s hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during
          each of their turns. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a
          main phase of their turn. See rule 305, “Lands.”</p>

        <p>116.2b Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they
          have priority. See rule 707, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”</p>

        <p>116.2c Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time, usually to end a continuous effect or
          to stop a delayed triggered ability from triggering. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an
          action any time they have priority, unless that effect specifies another timing restriction, for as long as
          the effect allows it.</p>

        <p>116.2d Some effects from static abilities allow a player to take an action to ignore the effect from that
          ability for a duration. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have
          priority.</p>

        <p>116.2e One card (Circling Vultures) has the ability “You may discard Circling Vultures any time you could
          cast an instant.” Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority.
        </p>

        <p>116.2f A player who has a card with suspend in their hand may exile that card. This is a special action. A
          player can take this action any time they have priority, but only if they could begin to cast that card by
          putting it onto the stack. See rule 702.61, “Suspend.”</p>

        <p>116.2g A player who has chosen a companion may pay {3} to put that card from outside the game into their
          hand. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is
          empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if they haven’t done so yet this game. (See rule 702.138,
          “Companion.”)</p>

        <p>116.2h In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die is a special action. A player can take this action any
          time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. Taking this action costs a
          player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn.
          Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if
          an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. See rule 901, “Planechase.”</p>

        <p>116.2i In a Conspiracy Draft game, turning a face-down conspiracy card in the command zone face up is a
          special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule 905.4a.</p>

        <p>116.3. If a player takes a special action, that player receives priority afterward.</p>

        <h2 id="117">
          117. Timing and Priority
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>117.1. Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action, which player can take actions at
          any given time is determined by a system of priority. The player with priority may cast spells, activate
          abilities, and take special actions.</p>

        <p>117.1a A player may cast an instant spell any time they have priority. A player may cast a noninstant spell
          during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty.</p>

        <p>117.1b A player may activate an activated ability any time they have priority.</p>

        <p>117.1c A player may take some special actions any time they have priority. A player may take other special
          actions during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty. See rule 116, “Special
          Actions.”</p>

        <p>117.1d A player may activate a mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or
          activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment (even
          in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability).</p>

        <p>117.2. Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or performed by the game rules, or
          are performed by players without receiving priority.</p>

        <p>117.2a Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a spell is being cast, an ability is
          being activated, or a spell or ability is resolving. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) However,
          nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers. Each time a player would receive priority, each
          ability that has triggered but hasn’t yet been put on the stack is put on the stack. See rule 117.5.</p>

        <p>117.2b Static abilities continuously affect the game. Priority doesn’t apply to them. (See rule 604,
          “Handling Static Abilities,” and rule 611, “Continuous Effects.”)</p>

        <p>117.2c Turn-based actions happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They’re dealt with before
          a player would receive priority. See rule 117.3a. Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step
          and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule 703, “Turn-Based Actions.”</p>

        <p>117.2d State-based actions happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule 704. They’re dealt
          with before a player would receive priority. See rule 117.5.</p>

        <p>117.2e Resolving spells and abilities may instruct players to make choices or take actions, or may allow
          players to activate mana abilities. Even if a player is doing so, no player has priority while a spell or
          ability is resolving. See rule 608, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”</p>

        <p>117.3. Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:</p>

        <p>117.3a The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based
          actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule 703) have been dealt with and abilities that
          trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during
          the untap step. Players usually don’t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 514.3).</p>

        <p>117.3b The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other than a mana ability) resolves.</p>

        <p>117.3c If a player has priority when they cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action, that
          player receives priority afterward.</p>

        <p>117.3d If a player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that player passes. If any mana is in
          that player’s mana pool, they announce what mana is there. Then the next player in turn order receives
          priority.</p>

        <p>117.4. If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between
          passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.
        </p>

        <p>117.5. Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a
          single event (see rule 704, “State-Based Actions”), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are
          performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack (see rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities”). These
          steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the
          player who would have received priority does so.</p>

        <p>117.6. In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, teams rather than individual players have
          priority. See rule 805, “Shared Team Turns Option.”</p>

        <p>117.7. If a player with priority casts a spell or activates an activated ability while another spell or
          ability is already on the stack, the new spell or ability has been cast or activated “in response to” the
          earlier spell or ability. The new spell or ability will resolve first. See rule 608, “Resolving Spells and
          Abilities.”</p>

        <h2 id="118">
          118. Costs
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>118.1. A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking
          place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that
          contains that cost.</p>

        <p>118.2. If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities.
          Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules 601.2f–h.</p>

        <p>118.3. A player can’t pay a cost without having the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a
          player with only 1 life can’t pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent that’s already tapped can’t be tapped to
          pay a cost. See rule 202, “Mana Cost and Color,” and rule 602, “Activating Activated Abilities.”</p>

        <p>118.3a Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a player’s mana pool. (Players can always pay
          0 mana.) If excess mana remains in that player’s mana pool after making that payment, the player announces
          what mana is still there.</p>

        <p>118.3b Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life from a player’s life total. (Players
          can always pay 0 life.)</p>

        <p>118.3c Activating mana abilities is not mandatory, even if paying a cost is.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Lodestone Golem, which says “Nonartifact spells cost {1} more to cast.” Another
          player removes the last time counter from a suspended sorcery card. That player must cast that spell if able,
          but doing so costs {1}. The player is forced to pay that cost if enough mana is in their mana pool, but the
          player isn’t forced to activate a mana ability to produce that mana. If they don’t, the card simply remains
          exiled.</p>

        <p>118.4. Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule 107.3.</p>

        <p>118.5. Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}. The action necessary for a player to pay
          such a cost is the player’s acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no
          resources, it’s not automatically paid.</p>

        <p>118.5a A spell whose mana cost is {0} must still be cast the same way as one with a cost greater than zero;
          it won’t cast itself automatically. The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is {0}.</p>

        <p>118.6. Some objects have no mana cost. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an
          unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a
          spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an
          unpayable cost is an illegal action.</p>

        <p>118.6a If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional cost is imposed, the cost is still
          unpayable. If an alternative cost is applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to
          cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be paid.</p>

        <p>118.7. What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana
          component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it’s considered to be {0}. Paying a cost
          changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.</p>

        <p>118.7a Effects that reduce a cost by an amount of generic mana affect only the generic mana component of that
          cost. They can’t affect the colored or colorless mana components of that cost.</p>

        <p>118.7b If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored or colorless mana, but the cost doesn’t require mana of
          that type, the cost is reduced by that amount of generic mana.</p>

        <p>118.7c If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color, the
          cost’s mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the cost’s generic mana component is reduced by
          the difference.</p>

        <p>118.7d If a cost is reduced by an amount of colorless mana that exceeds its colorless mana component, the
          cost’s colorless mana component is reduced to nothing and the cost’s generic mana component is reduced by the
          difference.</p>

        <p>118.7e If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that
          cost chooses one half of that symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see rule 601.2f). If a colored
          half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color. If a generic half is chosen, the cost is
          reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that half’s number.</p>

        <p>118.7f If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol, the cost is reduced
          by one mana of that symbol’s color.</p>

        <p>118.7g If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols, the cost is
          reduced by that much generic mana.</p>

        <p>118.8. Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spell’s
          rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same
          time they pay the spell’s mana cost or the ability’s activation cost. Note that some additional costs are
          listed in keywords; see rule 702.</p>

        <p>118.8a Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it’s being cast or to an ability as it’s
          being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces their intentions to pay any or all of those
          costs as described in rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>118.8b Some additional costs are optional.</p>

        <p>118.8c If an effect instructs a player to cast a spell “if able,” and that spell has a mandatory additional
          cost that includes actions involving cards with a stated quality in a hidden zone, the player isn’t required
          to cast that spell, even if those cards are present in that zone.</p>

        <p>118.8d Additional costs don’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it.
          Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.</p>

        <p>118.9. Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spell’s text, or applied
          to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spell’s mana cost. Alternative
          costs are usually phrased, “You may [action] rather than pay [this object’s] mana cost,” or “You may cast
          [this object] without paying its mana cost.” Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule
          702.</p>

        <p>118.9a Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it’s being cast. The controller of the
          spell announces their intentions to pay that cost as described in rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>118.9b Alternative costs are generally optional. An effect that allows you to cast a spell may require a
          certain alternative cost to be paid.</p>

        <p>118.9c An alternative cost doesn’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast
          it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.</p>

        <p>118.9d If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost
          reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost. (See rule 601.2f.)</p>

        <p>118.10. Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player can’t
          sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require
          sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn’t pay another spell or
          ability’s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.</p>

        <p>118.11. The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the
          actions that are performed don’t match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Psychic Vortex, an enchantment with a cumulative upkeep cost of “Draw a card,” and
          Obstinate Familiar, a creature that says “If you would draw a card, you may skip that draw instead.” The
          player may decide to pay Psychic Vortex’s cumulative upkeep cost and then draw no cards instead of drawing the
          appropriate amount. The cumulative upkeep cost has still been paid.</p>

        <p>118.12. Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something]. If [a player] [does,
          doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” or “[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t],
          [effect].” The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The “If [a player]
          [does, doesn’t, or can’t]” clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a
          mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.</p>
        <p>Example: You control Standstill, an enchantment that says “When a player casts a spell, sacrifice Standstill.
          If you do, each of that player’s opponents draws three cards.” A spell is cast, causing Standstill’s ability
          to trigger. Then an ability is activated that exiles Standstill. When Standstill’s ability resolves, you’re
          unable to pay the “sacrifice Standstill” cost. No player will draw cards.</p>
        <p>Example: Your opponent has cast Gather Specimens, a spell that says “If a creature would enter the
          battlefield under an opponent’s control this turn, it enters the battlefield under your control instead.” You
          control a face-down Dermoplasm, a creature with morph that says “When Dermoplasm is turned face up, you may
          put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield face up. If you do, return Dermoplasm to
          its owner’s hand.” You turn Dermoplasm face up, and you choose to put a creature card with morph from your
          hand onto the battlefield. Due to Gather Specimens, it enters the battlefield under your opponent’s control
          instead of yours. However, since you chose to pay the cost, Dermoplasm is still returned to its owner’s hand.
        </p>

        <p>118.12a Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something] unless [a player does
          something else].” This means the same thing as “[A player may do something else]. If [that player doesn’t],
          [do something].”</p>

        <p>118.12b Some effects offer a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards
          found in that zone, followed by an “If [a player] does” clause. This clause checks whether the player chose to
          search, not whether the player took any of the additional actions.</p>

        <p>118.13. Some costs contain mana symbols that can be paid in multiple ways. These include hybrid mana symbols
          and Phyrexian mana symbols.</p>

        <p>118.13a If the mana cost of a spell or the activation cost of an activated ability contains a mana symbol
          that can be paid in multiple ways, the choice of how to pay for that symbol is made as its controller proposes
          that spell or ability (see rule 601.2b).</p>

        <p>118.13b If a cost paid during the resolution of a spell or ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in
          multiple ways, the player paying that cost chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that
          cost.</p>

        <p>118.13c If the cost associated with a special action contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple
          ways, the player taking the special action chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that
          cost.</p>

          119. Life
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>119.1. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different
          starting life totals.</p>

        <p>119.1a In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team’s starting life total is 30. See rule 810, “Two-Headed Giant
          Variant.”</p>

        <p>119.1b In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their
          vanguard card. See rule 902, “Vanguard.”</p>

        <p>119.1c In a Commander game, each player’s starting life total is 40. See rule 903, “Commander.”</p>

        <p>119.1d. In a two-player Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game,
          each player’s starting life total is 30. See rule 903.12, “Brawl Option.”</p>

        <p>119.1e In an Archenemy game, the archenemy’s starting life total is 40. See rule 904, “Archenemy.”</p>

        <p>119.2. Damage dealt to a player normally causes that player to lose that much life. See rule 120.3.</p>

        <p>119.3. If an effect causes a player to gain life or lose life, that player’s life total is adjusted
          accordingly.</p>

        <p>119.4. If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, the player may do so only
          if their life total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays life, the payment
          is subtracted from their life total; in other words, the player loses that much life. (Players can always pay
          0 life.)</p>

        <p>119.4a If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0 in a Two-Headed Giant
          game, the player may do so only if their team’s life total is greater than or equal to the total amount of
          life both team members are paying for that cost or effect. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted
          from their team’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)</p>

        <p>119.5. If an effect sets a player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary
          amount of life to end up with the new total.</p>

        <p>119.6. If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>119.7. If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, that player can’t make an exchange such that the
          player’s life total would become higher; in that case, the exchange won’t happen. Similarly, if an effect
          redistributes life totals, a player can’t receive a new life total such that the player’s life total would
          become higher. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life can’t be paid, and a replacement
          effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player won’t do anything.</p>

        <p>119.8. If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, that player can’t make an exchange such that the
          player’s life total would become lower; in that case, the exchange won’t happen. Similarly, if an effect
          redistributes life totals, a player can’t receive a new life total such that the player’s life total would
          become lower. In addition, a cost that involves having that player pay life can’t be paid.</p>

        <p>119.9. Some triggered abilities are written, “Whenever [a player] gains life, . . . .” Such abilities are
          treated as though they are written, “Whenever a source causes [a player] to gain life, . . . .” If a player
          gains 0 life, no life gain event has occurred, and these abilities won’t trigger.</p>

        <p>119.10. Some replacement effects are written, “If [a player] would gain life, . . . .” Such abilities are
          treated as though they are written, “If a source would cause [a player] to gain life, . . . .” If a player
          gains 0 life, no life gain event would occur, and these effects won’t apply.</p>

        <h2 id="120">
          120. Damage
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>120.1. Objects can deal damage to creatures, planeswalkers, and players. This is generally detrimental to the
          object or player that receives that damage. An object that deals damage is the source of that damage.</p>

        <p>120.1a Damage can’t be dealt to an object that’s neither a creature nor a planeswalker.</p>

        <p>120.2. Any object can deal damage.</p>

        <p>120.2a Damage may be dealt as a result of combat. Each attacking and blocking creature deals combat damage
          equal to its power during the combat damage step.</p>

        <p>120.2b Damage may be dealt as an effect of a spell or ability. The spell or ability will specify which object
          deals that damage.</p>

        <p>120.3. Damage may have one or more of the following results, depending on whether the recipient of the damage
          is a player or permanent, the characteristics of the damage’s source, and the characteristics of the damage’s
          recipient (if it’s a permanent).</p>

        <p>120.3a Damage dealt to a player by a source without infect causes that player to lose that much life.</p>

        <p>120.3b Damage dealt to a player by a source with infect causes that source’s controller to give the player
          that many poison counters.</p>

        <p>120.3c Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from that planeswalker.
        </p>

        <p>120.3d Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither and/or infect causes that source’s controller to
          put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature.</p>

        <p>120.3e Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect causes that much damage to be
          marked on that creature.</p>

        <p>120.3f Damage dealt by a source with lifelink causes that source’s controller to gain that much life, in
          addition to the damage’s other results.</p>

        <p>120.4. Damage is processed in a four-part sequence.</p>

        <p>120.4a First, if an effect is causing damage to be dealt to a creature and that effect specifies that excess
          damage is dealt to another object or player instead, the damage event is modified to deal damage accordingly.
          Excess damage is damage greater than lethal damage that would be dealt to a creature. Lethal damage is the
          creature’s toughness minus damage marked on that creature and other damage being dealt to it at the same time
          as this damage. Any damage greater than 1 is excess damage if the source dealing that damage has deathtouch.
        </p>

        <p>120.4b Second, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention effects that interact with damage.
          (See rule 614, “Replacement Effects,” and rule 615, “Prevention Effects.”) Abilities that trigger when damage
          is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack.</p>

        <p>120.4c Third, damage that’s been dealt is processed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that
          interact with those results (such as life loss or counters).</p>

        <p>120.4d Finally, the damage event occurs.</p>
        <p>Example: A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says “If you would gain life, you gain
          twice that much life instead,” attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. It’s blocked by a 2/2
          creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the
          blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to
          the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2
          creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event is
          now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the
          3/3 creature]. Boon Reflection’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on
          the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage
          event occurs.</p>
        <p>Example: The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says “If you control a
          creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.” That player is at
          2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says “The
          next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage
          prevented this way,” targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the
          defending player]. Awe Strike’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the
          defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event
          is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worship’s effect sees that the
          damage event would not reduce the player’s life total to less than 1, so Worship’s effect is not applied. Then
          the damage event occurs.</p>

        <p>120.5. Damage dealt to a creature or planeswalker doesn’t destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage
          doesn’t destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or planeswalker, or otherwise put it
          into its owner’s graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule 704.</p>
        <p>Example: A player casts Lightning Bolt, an instant that says “Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target,”
          targeting a 2/2 creature. After Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to that creature, the creature is destroyed as a
          state-based action. Neither Lightning Bolt nor the damage dealt by Lightning Bolt destroyed that creature.</p>

        <p>120.6. Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a
          creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature
          has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage marked on a
          permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.15, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup step (see rule
          514.2).</p>

        <p>120.7. The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of
          damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred
          to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed
          triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in);
          or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal
          choice. See rule 609.7, “Sources of Damage.”</p>

        <p>120.8. If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on
          damage being dealt won’t trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt
          by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to
          replace, so they have no effect.</p>

        <p>120.9. If an ability triggers on damage being dealt by a specific source or sources, and the effect refers to
          the “damage dealt,” it refers only to the damage dealt by the specified sources and not to any damage dealt at
          the same time by other sources.</p>

        <h2 id="121">
          121. Drawing a Card
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>121.1. A player draws a card by putting the top card of their library into their hand. This is done as a
          turn-based action during each player’s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell
          or ability.</p>

        <p>121.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player
          performs that many individual card draws.</p>

        <p>121.2a An instruction to draw multiple cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number
          of cards drawn. This modification occurs before considering any of the individual card draws. See rule 616.1f.
        </p>

        <p>121.2b Some effects say that a player can’t draw more than one card each turn. Such an effect applies to
          individual card draws. Instructions to draw multiple cards may still be partially carried out. However, if an
          effect offers the player a choice to draw multiple cards, the affected player can’t choose to do so.
          Similarly, the player can’t pay a cost that includes drawing multiple cards.</p>

        <p>121.2c If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards, the active player performs all of their
          draws first, then each other player in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>121.2d If a rule or effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a game that’s using the shared
          team turns option (such as a Two-Headed Giant game), first each player on the active team, in whatever order
          that team likes, performs their draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.
        </p>

        <p>121.3. If there are no cards in a player’s library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a
          card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player can’t draw cards and another
          effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can’t choose to do so.</p>

        <p>121.3a The same principles apply if the player who’s making the choice is not the player who would draw the
          card. If the latter player has no cards in their library, the choice can be taken. If an effect says that the
          latter player can’t draw a card, the choice can’t be taken.</p>

        <p>121.4. A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game the next time a
          player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>121.5. If an effect moves cards from a player’s library to that player’s hand without using the word “draw,”
          the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and
          effects that replace card draws, as well as if the player’s library is empty.</p>

        <p>121.6. Some effects replace card draws.</p>

        <p>121.6a An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no
          cards in the affected player’s library.</p>

        <p>121.6b If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed
          before resuming the sequence.</p>

        <p>121.6c Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it’s drawn. If the draw is replaced, the
          additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any
          subsequent replacement effects.</p>

        <p>121.7. Some replacement effects and prevention effects result in one or more card draws. In such a case, if
          there are any parts of the original event that haven’t been replaced, those parts occur first, then the card
          draws happen one at a time.</p>

        <p>121.8. If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell is being cast, the drawn card is
          kept face down until that spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i) or until the casting process is reversed (see
          rule 723, “Handling Illegal Actions”). While face down, it’s considered to have no characteristics. The same
          is true with relation to another ability being activated. If an effect allows or instructs a player to reveal
          the card as it’s being drawn, it’s revealed after the spell becomes cast or the ability becomes activated.</p>

        <p>121.9. If an effect gives a player the option to reveal a card as they draw it, that player may look at that
          card as they draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.</p>

        <h2 id="122">
          122. Counters
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>122.1. A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts
          with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. Notably, a counter is
          not a token, and a token is not a counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.</p>

        <p>122.1a A +X/+Y counter on a creature or on a creature card in a zone other than the battlefield, where X and
          Y are numbers, adds X to that object’s power and Y to that object’s toughness. Similarly, -X/-Y counters
          subtract from power and toughness. See rule 613.4c.</p>

        <p>122.1b A keyword counter on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object
          to gain that keyword. The keywords that a keyword counter can be are flying, first strike, double strike,
          deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, trample, and vigilance, as well as any
          variants of those keywords. See rule 613.1f.</p>

        <p>122.1c The number of loyalty counters on a planeswalker on the battlefield indicates how much loyalty it has.
          A planeswalker with 0 loyalty is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>122.1d If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See
          rule 704. A player is “poisoned” if they have one or more poison counters. (See rule 810 for additional rules
          for Two-Headed Giant games.)</p>

        <p>122.2. Counters on an object are not retained if that object moves from one zone to another. The counters are
          not “removed”; they simply cease to exist. See rule 400.7.</p>

        <p>122.3. If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are
          removed from it as a state-based action, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on
          it. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>122.4. If a permanent with an ability that says it can’t have more than N counters of a certain kind on it
          has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it as a state-based
          action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>122.5. If an effect says to “move” a counter, it means to remove that counter from the object it’s currently
          on and put it onto a second object. If either of these actions isn’t possible, it’s not possible to move a
          counter, and no counter is removed from or put onto anything. This may occur if the first and second objects
          are the same object; if the first object doesn’t have the appropriate kind of counter on it; if the second
          object can’t have counters put onto it; or if either object is no longer in the correct zone.</p>

        <p>122.6. Some spells and abilities refer to counters being put on an object. This refers to putting counters on
          that object while it’s on the battlefield and also to an object that’s given counters as it enters the
          battlefield.</p>

        <p>122.6a If an object enters the battlefield with counters on it, the effect causing the object to be given
          counters may specify which player puts those counters on it. If the effect doesn’t specify a player, the
          object’s controller puts those counters on it.</p>

        <p>122.7. An ability that triggers “When/Whenever the Nth [kind] counter” is put on an object triggers when one
          or more counters of the appropriate kind are put on the object such that the object had fewer than N counters
          on it before the counters were put on it and N or more counters on it after.</p>

        <p>122.8. If a triggered ability instructs a player to “put those counters” or to “put [an object’s] counters”
          on another object and that ability’s trigger condition or effect checks that the object with those counters
          left the battlefield, that player puts a number of counters on the second object of each kind the first object
          had before it left the battlefield. The player doesn’t move counters from one object to another.</p>

          200. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>200.1. The parts of a card are name, mana cost, illustration, color indicator, type line, expansion symbol,
          text box, power and toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, life modifier, illustration credit, legal text, and
          collector number. Some cards may have more than one of any or all of these parts.</p>

        <p>200.2. Some parts of a card are also characteristics of the object that has them. See rule 109.3.</p>

        <p>200.3. Some objects that aren’t cards (tokens, copies of cards, and copies of spells) have some of the parts
          of a card, but only the ones that are also characteristics. See rule 111 and rule 706.</p>

        <h2 id="201">
          201. Name
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>201.1. The name of a card is printed on its upper left corner.</p>

        <p>201.2. A card’s name is always considered to be the English version of its name, regardless of printed
          language.</p>

        <p>201.2a Two objects have the same name if their names are identical.</p>

        <p>201.2b If an object has more than one name, it has the same name as another object if there are one or more
          names that both objects have in common.</p>

        <p>201.2c Two or more objects have different names if there are no names that both objects have in common.</p>

        <p>201.3. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player must choose the name of a card in
          the Oracle card reference. (See rule 108.1.) A player may not choose the name of a token unless it’s also the
          name of a card.</p>

        <p>201.3a If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, the player must choose
          the name of a card whose Oracle text matches those characteristics. (See rule 108.1.)</p>
        <p>Example: Dispossess reads, in part, “Choose an artifact card name.” The player can choose the name of any
          artifact card, even one that’s not legal in the format of the current game. The player can’t choose Island,
          even if an Island on the battlefield has been turned into artifact by some effect.</p>

        <p>201.3b If a player wants to choose the name of a split card, the player must choose the name of one of its
          halves, but not both. (See rule 708.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain
          characteristics, use only that half’s characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3c If a player wants to choose a flip card’s alternative name, the player may do so. (See rule 709.) If a
          player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use the card’s characteristics as
          modified by its alternative characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3d If a player wants to choose the name of the back face of a double-faced card, the player may do so.
          (See rule 711.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use only the
          characteristics of the back face to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3e If a player wants to choose the name of the combined back face of a meld pair, the player may do so.
          (See rule 712.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use only the
          characteristics of the combined back face to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3f If a player wants to choose an adventurer card’s alternative name, the player may do so. (See rule
          715.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use the card’s
          characteristics as modified by its alternative characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.4. Text that refers to the object it’s on by name means just that particular object and not any other
          objects with that name, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects.</p>

        <p>201.4a If an ability’s effect grants another ability to an object, and that second ability refers to that
          first ability’s source by name, the name refers only to the specific object that is that first ability’s
          source, not to any other object with the same name. This is also true if the second ability is copied onto a
          new object.</p>
        <p>Example: Gutter Grime has an ability that reads “Whenever a nontoken creature you control dies, put a slime
          counter on Gutter Grime, then create a green Ooze creature token with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are
          each equal to the number of slime counters on Gutter Grime.’” The ability granted to the token only looks at
          the Gutter Grime that created the token, not at any other Gutter Grime on the battlefield. A copy of that
          token would also have an ability that referred only to the Gutter Grime that created the original token.</p>

        <p>201.4b If an ability of an object refers to that object by name, and an object with a different name gains
          that ability, each instance of the first name in the gained ability that refers to the first object by name
          should be treated as the second name.</p>
        <p>Example: Quicksilver Elemental says, in part, “{U}: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of
          target creature until end of turn.” If it gains an ability that says “{G}: Regenerate Cudgel Troll,”
          activating that ability will regenerate Quicksilver Elemental, not the Cudgel Troll it gained the ability
          from.</p>
        <p>Example: Glacial Ray is an instant with splice onto Arcane that says “Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any
          target.” If it’s spliced onto a Kodama’s Reach, that Kodama’s Reach deals 2 damage to the target.</p>
        <p>Example: Dimir Doppelganger says “{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger
          becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” Dimir Doppelganger’s ability is activated targeting a
          Runeclaw Bear card. The Doppelganger becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear and gains an ability that should be
          treated as saying “{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Runeclaw Bear becomes a copy of
          that card and gains this ability.”</p>

        <p>201.4c Text printed on some legendary cards refers to that card by a shortened version of its name. Instances
          of a card’s shortened name used in this manner are treated as though they used the card’s full name.</p>

        <p>201.5. Some promotional versions of Ikoria™: Lair of Behemoths cards feature a name other than their own in
          the upper left corner, with their normal name in a secondary title bar below it. These cards have only the
          card name specified in the secondary title bar, not the name printed where a card’s name would normally
          appear.</p>

        <h2 id="202">
          202. Mana Cost and Color
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>202.1. A card’s mana cost is indicated by mana symbols near the top of the card. (See rule 107.4.) On most
          cards, these symbols are printed in the upper right corner. Some cards from the Future Sight set have
          alternate frames in which the mana symbols appear to the left of the illustration.</p>

        <p>202.1a The mana cost of an object represents what a player must spend from their mana pool to cast that card.
          Unless an object’s mana cost includes Phyrexian mana symbols (see rule 107.4f), paying that mana cost requires
          matching the type of any colored or colorless mana symbols as well as paying the generic mana indicated in the
          cost.</p>

        <p>202.1b Some objects have no mana cost. This normally includes all land cards, any other cards that have no
          mana symbols where their mana cost would appear, tokens (unless the effect that creates them specifies
          otherwise), and nontraditional Magic cards. Having no mana cost represents an unpayable cost (see rule 118.6).
          Note that lands are played without paying any costs (see rule 305, “Lands”).</p>

        <p>202.2. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its
          frame.</p>

        <p>202.2a The five colors are white, blue, black, red, and green. The white mana symbol is represented by {W},
          blue by {U}, black by {B}, red by {R}, and green by {G}.</p>
        <p>Example: An object with a mana cost of {2}{W} is white, an object with a mana cost of {2} is colorless, and
          one with a mana cost of {2}{W}{B} is both white and black.</p>

        <p>202.2b Objects with no colored mana symbols in their mana costs are colorless.</p>

        <p>202.2c An object with two or more different colored mana symbols in its mana cost is each of the colors of
          those mana symbols. Most multicolored cards are printed with a gold frame, but this is not a requirement for a
          card to be multicolored.</p>

        <p>202.2d An object with one or more hybrid mana symbols and/or Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is all
          of the colors of those mana symbols, in addition to any other colors the object might be. (Most cards with
          hybrid mana symbols in their mana costs are printed in a two-tone frame. See rule 107.4e.)</p>

        <p>202.2e An object may have a color indicator printed to the left of the type line. That object is each color
          denoted by that color indicator. (See rule 204.)</p>

        <p>202.2f Effects may change an object’s color, give a color to a colorless object, or make a colored object
          become colorless; see rule 105.3.</p>

        <p>202.3. The converted mana cost of an object is a number equal to the total amount of mana in its mana cost,
          regardless of color.</p>
        <p>Example: A mana cost of {3}{U}{U} translates to a converted mana cost of 5.</p>

        <p>202.3a The converted mana cost of an object with no mana cost is 0, unless that object is the back face of a
          transforming double-faced permanent or is a melded permanent.</p>

        <p>202.3b The converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced permanent’s back face is calculated as though
          it had the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent is a copy of the back face of a transforming
          double-faced card (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the converted mana
          cost of that permanent is 0.</p>
        <p>Example: Huntmaster of the Fells is a transforming double-faced card with mana cost {2}{R}{G}. Its converted
          mana cost is 4. After it transforms to its other face (Ravager of the Fells), its converted mana cost remains
          4.</p>
        <p>Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its converted mana cost is 0.</p>
        <p>Example: Insectile Aberration is the back face of a transforming double-faced card whose front face has mana
          cost {U}. It becomes a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its converted mana cost becomes 0.</p>

        <p>202.3c The converted mana cost of a melded permanent is calculated as though it had the combined mana cost of
          the front faces of each card that represents it. If a permanent is a copy of a melded permanent (even if that
          copy is represented by two other meld cards), the converted mana cost of the copy is 0.</p>

        <p>202.3d The converted mana cost of a split card not on the stack or of a fused split spell on the stack is
          determined from the combined mana costs of its halves. Otherwise, while a split card is on the stack, the
          converted mana cost of the spell is determined by the mana cost of the half that was chosen to be cast. See
          rule 708, “Split Cards.”</p>

        <p>202.3e When calculating the converted mana cost of an object with an {X} in its mana cost, X is treated as 0
          while the object is not on the stack, and X is treated as the number chosen for it while the object is on the
          stack.</p>

        <p>202.3f When calculating the converted mana cost of an object with a hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost, use
          the largest component of each hybrid symbol.</p>
        <p>Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {1}{W/U}{W/U} is 3.</p>
        <p>Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {2/B}{2/B}{2/B} is 6.</p>

        <p>202.3g Each Phyrexian mana symbol in a card’s mana cost contributes 1 to its converted mana cost.</p>
        <p>Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {1}{W/P}{W/P} is 3.</p>

        <p>202.4. Any additional cost listed in an object’s rules text or imposed by an effect isn’t part of the mana
          cost. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”) Such costs are paid at the same time as the spell’s other costs.</p>

        <h2 id="203">
          203. Illustration
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>203.1. The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no effect on game play. For example, a
          creature doesn’t have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if it’s depicted as flying.</p>

        <h2 id="204">
          204. Color Indicator
        </h2>
<hr>

        <p>204.1. The color indicator is printed to the left of the type line directly below the illustration. It
          consists of a circular symbol filled in with one or more colors. A color indicator is usually found on nonland
          cards without a mana cost.</p>

        <p>204.2. An object with a color indicator is each color denoted by that color indicator.</p>

        <h2 id="205">
          205. Type Line
        </h2>

        <p>205.1. The type line is printed directly below the illustration. It contains the card’s card type(s). It also
          contains the card’s subtype(s) and supertype(s), if applicable.</p>

        <p>205.1a Some effects set an object’s card type. In such cases, the new card type(s) replaces any existing card
          types. Counters, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the
          new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an object’s subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces
          any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types,
          planeswalker types, or spell types). If an object’s card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that
          card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they
          are also removed for the entire time the object’s card type is removed. Removing an object’s subtype doesn’t
          affect its card types at all.</p>

        <p>205.1b Some effects change an object’s card type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a
          prior card type, supertype, or subtype. In such cases, all the object’s prior card types, supertypes, and
          subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use the phrase “in addition to its types” or that
          state that something is “still a [type, supertype, or subtype].” Some effects state that an object becomes an
          “artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes.
          Some effects state that an object becomes a “[creature type or types] artifact creature”; these effects also
          allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes other than creature types, but replace any
          existing creature types.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” The affected lands now have
          two card types: creature and land. If there were any lands that were also artifacts before the ability’s
          effect applied to them, those lands would become “artifact land creatures,” not just “creatures,” or “land
          creatures.” The effect allows them to retain both the artifact and land card types. In addition, each land
          affected by the ability retains any land types and supertypes it had before the ability took effect.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads, “All artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures.” If a permanent is both an artifact and
          an enchantment, it will become an artifact enchantment creature.</p>

        <h2>
          <p>205.2. Card Types</p>


        <p>205.2a The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane,
          planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard. See section 3, “Card Types.”</p>

        <p>205.2b Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects satisfy
          the criteria for any effect that applies to any of their card types.</p>

        <p>205.2c Tokens have card types even though they aren’t cards. The same is true of copies of spells and copies
          of cards.</p>

        <p>205.3. Subtypes</p>

        <p>205.3a A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line.</p>

        <p>205.3b Subtypes of each card type except plane are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each
          word after the dash is a separate subtype; such objects may have multiple types. Subtypes of planes are also
          listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single
          subtype.</p>
        <p>Example: “Basic Land — Mountain” means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain. “Creature — Goblin
          Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard. “Artifact — Equipment” means the
          card is an artifact with the subtype Equipment.</p>

        <p>205.3c If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its
          appropriate card type.</p>
        <p>Example: Dryad Arbor’s type line says “Land Creature — Forest Dryad.” Forest is a land type, and Dryad is a
          creature type.</p>

        <p>205.3d An object can’t gain a subtype that doesn’t correspond to one of that object’s types.</p>

        <p>205.3e If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one,
          existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player can’t choose
          a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type.</p>
        <p>Example: When choosing a creature type, “Merfolk” or “Wizard” is acceptable, but “Merfolk Wizard” is not.
          Words like “artifact,” “opponent,” “Swamp,” or “truck” can’t be chosen because they aren’t creature types.</p>

        <p>205.3f Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete. Many cards have retroactively received
          subtypes. Use the Oracle card reference to determine what a card’s subtypes are. (See rule 108.1.)</p>

        <p>205.3g Artifacts have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called artifact types. The
          artifact types are Clue, Contraption, Equipment (see rule 301.5), Food, Fortification (see rule 301.6), Gold,
          Treasure, and Vehicle (see rule 301.7).</p>

        <p>205.3h Enchantments have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called enchantment types. The
          enchantment types are Aura (see rule 303.4), Cartouche, Curse, Saga (see rule 714), and Shrine.</p>

        <p>205.3i Lands have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called land types. The land types are
          Desert, Forest, Gate, Island, Lair, Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Power-Plant, Swamp, Tower, and Urza’s.</p>
        <p>Of that list, Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp are the basic land types. See rule 305.6.</p>

        <p>205.3j Planeswalkers have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planeswalker types. The
          planeswalker types are <br><code>Ajani, Aminatou, Angrath, Arlinn, Ashiok, Basri, Bolas, Calix, Chandra, Dack, Daretti,
          Davriel, Domri, Dovin, Elspeth, Estrid, Freyalise, Garruk, Gideon, Huatli, Jace, Jaya, Karn, Kasmina, Kaya,
          Kiora, Koth, Liliana, Lukka, Nahiri, Narset, Nissa, Nixilis, Oko, Ral, Rowan, Saheeli, Samut, Sarkhan, Serra,

          Yanggu, and Yanling.</code></p>

        <p>205.3k Instants and sorceries share their lists of subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. The spell
          types are Adventure, Arcane, and Trap.</p>

          <br>

          <p>205.3m Creatures and tribals share their lists of subtypes; these subtypes are called creature types. The

        <p>205.3n Planes have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planar types. The planar types
          are: <br>
          <code>Alara, Arkhos, Azgol, Belenon, Bolas’s Meditation Realm, Dominaria, Equilor, Ergamon, Fabacin, Innistrad,
          Iquatana, Ir, Kaldheim, Kamigawa, Karsus, Kephalai, Kinshala, Kolbahan, Kyneth, Lorwyn, Luvion, Mercadia,
          Mirrodin, Moag, Mongseng, Muraganda, New Phyrexia, Phyrexia, Pyrulea, Rabiah, Rath, Ravnica, Regatha, Segovia,
          Serra’s Realm, Shadowmoor, Shandalar, Ulgrotha, Valla, Vryn, Wildfire, Xerex, and Zendikar.</code></p>

        <p>205.3p Phenomenon cards, scheme cards, vanguard cards, and conspiracy cards have no subtypes.</p>

        <p>205.4. Supertypes</p>

        <p>205.4a A card can also have one or more supertypes. These are printed directly before its card types. The
          supertypes are basic, legendary, ongoing, snow, and world.</p>

        <p>205.4b An object’s supertype is independent of its card type and subtype, even though some supertypes are
          closely identified with specific card types. Changing an object’s card types or subtypes won’t change its
          supertypes. Changing an object’s supertypes won’t change its card types or subtypes. When an object gains or
          loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” If any of the affected lands
          were legendary, they are still legendary.</p>

        <p>205.4c Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a
          nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.</p>
        <p>Cards printed in sets prior to the Eighth Edition core set didn’t use the word “basic” to indicate a basic
          land. Cards from those sets with the following names are basic lands and have received errata in the Oracle
          card reference accordingly: Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, Swamp, Snow-Covered Forest, Snow-Covered Island,
          Snow-Covered Mountain, Snow-Covered Plains, and Snow-Covered Swamp.</p>

        <p>205.4d Any permanent with the supertype “legendary” is subject to the state-based action for legendary
          permanents, also called the “legend rule” (see rule 704.5j).</p>

        <p>205.4e Any instant or sorcery spell with the supertype “legendary” is subject to a casting restriction. A
          player can’t cast a legendary instant or sorcery spell unless that player controls a legendary creature or a
          legendary planeswalker.</p>

        <p>205.4f Any permanent with the supertype “world” is subject to the state-based action for world permanents,
          also called the “world rule” (see rule 704.5k).</p>

        <p>205.4g Any permanent with the supertype “snow” is a snow permanent. Any permanent that doesn’t have this
          supertype is a nonsnow permanent, regardless of its name.</p>

        <p>205.4h Any scheme card with the supertype “ongoing” is exempt from the state-based action for schemes (see
          rule 704.6e).</p>

        <h2 id="206">
          206. Expansion Symbol
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>206.1. The expansion symbol indicates which Magic set a card is from. It’s a small icon normally printed
          below the right edge of the illustration. It has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>206.2. The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card within its set. A red-orange symbol
          indicates the card is mythic rare. A gold symbol indicates the card is rare. A silver symbol indicates the
          card is uncommon. A black or white symbol indicates the card is common or is a basic land. A purple symbol
          signifies a special rarity; to date, only the Time Spiral® “timeshifted” cards, which were rarer than that
          set’s rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the Exodus™ set, all expansion symbols were
          black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified
          Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didn’t have expansion symbols at all.)</p>

        <p>206.3. Previously, a spell or ability that affected cards from a particular set checked for that set’s
          expansion symbol. These cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to say they affect cards “with
          a name originally printed” in a particular set.</p>

        <p>206.3a One card (City in a Bottle) refers to permanents and cards with a name originally printed in the

        <p>206.4. Players may include cards from any printing in their constructed decks if those cards appear in sets
          allowed in that format (or those cards are specifically allowed by the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules).
          See the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for the current definitions of the constructed formats
          (WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents).</p>

        <p>206.5. The full list of expansions and expansion symbols can be found in the Card Set Archive section of the
          Magic website (Magic.Wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive).</p>

        <h2 id="207">
          207. Text Box
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>207.1. The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the
          card’s abilities.</p>

        <p>207.2. The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function.</p>

        <p>207.2a Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes a rule that applies to that card.
          It usually appears on the same line as the ability it’s relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it
          applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability.</p>

        <p>207.2b Flavor text is italicized text that, like the illustration, adds artistic appeal to the game. It
          appears below the rules text.</p>

        <p>207.2c An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Ability words are similar to
          keywords in that they tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no special rules
          meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive Rules. The ability words are adamant, addendum,
          battalion, bloodrush, channel, chroma, cohort, constellation, converge, council’s dilemma, delirium, domain,
          eminence, enrage, fateful hour, ferocious, formidable, grandeur, hellbent, heroic, imprint, inspired, join
          forces, kinship, landfall, lieutenant, metalcraft, morbid, parley, radiance, raid, rally, revolt, spell
          mastery, strive, sweep, tempting offer, threshold, undergrowth, and will of the council.</p>

        <p>207.3. Some cards have decorative icons in the background of their text boxes. For example, a guild icon
          appears in the text box of many cards associated with the guilds of Ravnica, and a faction icon appears in the
          text box of most Scars of Mirrodin™ block cards. Similarly, many promotional cards include decorative icons.
          These icons have no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>207.4. The chaos symbol {CHAOS} appears in the text box of each plane card to the left of a triggered ability
          that triggers whenever {CHAOS} is rolled on the planar die. The symbol itself has no special rules meaning.
        </p>

        <h2 id="208">
          208. Power/Toughness
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>208.1. A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its lower right corner. The first
          number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of
          damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and
          toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.</p>

        <p>208.2. Rather than a fixed number, some creature cards have power and/or toughness that includes a star (*).
        </p>

        <p>208.2a The card may have a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness according to
          some stated condition. (See rule 604.3.) Such an ability is worded “[This creature’s] [power or toughness] is
          equal to . . .” or “[This creature’s] power and toughness are each equal to . . .” This ability functions
          everywhere, even outside the game. If the ability needs to use a number that can’t be determined, including
          inside a calculation, use 0 instead of that number.</p>
        <p>Example: Lost Order of Jarkeld has power and toughness each equal to 1+*. It has the abilities “As Lost Order
          of Jarkeld enters the battlefield, choose an opponent” and “Lost Order of Jarkeld’s power and toughness are
          each equal to 1 plus the number of creatures the chosen player controls.” While Lost Order of Jarkeld isn’t on
          the battlefield, there won’t be a chosen player. Its power and toughness will each be equal to 1 plus 0, so
          it’s 1/1.</p>

        <p>208.2b The card may have a static ability that creates a replacement effect that sets the creature’s power
          and toughness to one of a number of specific values as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up. (See
          rule 614, “Replacement Effects.”) Such an ability is worded “As [this creature] enters the battlefield . . .
          ,” “As [this creature] is turned face up . . . ,” or “[This creature] enters the battlefield as . . .” and
          lists two or more specific power and toughness values (and may also list additional characteristics). The
          characteristics chosen or determined with these effects affect the creature’s copiable values. (See rule
          706.2.) While the card isn’t on the battlefield, its power and toughness are each considered to be 0.</p>

        <p>208.3. A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if it’s a card with a power and toughness
          printed on it (such as a Vehicle). A noncreature object not on the battlefield has power or toughness only if
          it has a power and toughness printed on it.</p>

        <p>208.3a If an effect would be created that affects the power and/or toughness of a noncreature permanent, that
          effect is created even though it doesn’t do anything unless that permanent becomes a creature.</p>
        <p>Example: Veteran Motorist has the ability “Whenever Veteran Motorist crews a Vehicle, that Vehicle gets +1/+1
          until end of turn,” and it’s tapped to pay the crew cost of a Vehicle. This triggered ability resolves while
          the Vehicle it crewed isn’t yet a creature. The continuous effect is created and will apply to the Vehicle
          once it becomes a creature.</p>

        <p>208.4. Effects that set a creature’s power and/or toughness to specific values may refer to that creature’s
          “base power,” “base toughness,” or “base power and toughness.” Other continuous effects may further modify the
          creature’s power and toughness. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>

        <p>208.5. If a creature somehow has no value for its power, its power is 0. The same is true for toughness.</p>

        <h2 id="209">
          209. Loyalty
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>209.1. Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its
          loyalty while it’s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the battlefield
          with that many loyalty counters on it.</p>

        <p>209.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow
          special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority
          and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanent’s loyalty
          abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”</p>

        <h2 id="210">
          210. Hand Modifier
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>210.1. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by
          a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting hand size
          and the maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner are determined. See rule 103.4.</p>

        <h2 id="211">
          211. Life Modifier
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>211.1. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by
          a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total
          of the vanguard card’s owner is determined. See rule 103.3.</p>

        <h2 id="212">
          212. Information Below the Text Box
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>212.1. Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. Not all card sets
          were printed with all of the information listed below on each card.</p>

        <p>212.1a Most card sets feature collector numbers. This information is printed in the form [card number]/[total
          cards in the set] or simply [card number]. Some cards, such as unique cards in Planeswalker Decks, have card
          numbers that exceed the listed total number of cards.</p>

        <p>212.1b A card’s rarity is indicated with a single letter following the collector number.</p>

        <p>212.1c Some promotional cards include information to indicate the specific promotion the card is associated
          with.</p>

        <p>212.1d The three-character code representing the set in which a card is printed and the two-character code
          representing the language in which a card is printed are separated by a bullet point. If a card is premium,
          these codes are instead separated by a star.</p>

        <p>212.1e The illustration credit for a card follows the paintbrush icon or, on older cards, the abbreviation
          “Illus.”</p>

        <p>212.1f Legal text (the fine print at the bottom or bottom-right of the card) lists the trademark and
          copyright information.</p>

        <h2 id="300">
          300. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>300.1. The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane,
          planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard.</p>

        <p>300.2. Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects combine
          the aspects of each of those card types, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or all of
          those card types.</p>

        <p>300.2a An object that’s both a land and another card type (for example, an artifact land) can only be played
          as a land. It can’t be cast as a spell.</p>

        <p>300.2b Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal card follow the rules for
          casting and resolving a card of the other card type.</p>

        <h2 id="301">
          301. Artifacts
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>301.1. A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from their hand during a main phase of their turn
          when the stack is empty. Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”)</p>

        <p>301.2. When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>

        <p>301.3. Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Artifact — Equipment.”
          Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Artifacts may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3g for
          the complete list of artifact types.</p>

        <p>301.4. Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type. Most artifacts have no colored mana
          symbols in their mana costs, and are therefore colorless. However, there is no correlation between being
          colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless objects may be card types other than
          artifact.</p>

        <p>301.5. Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It can’t
          legally be attached to anything that isn’t a creature.</p>

        <p>301.5a The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the “equipped creature.” The Equipment is attached
          to, or “equips,” that creature.</p>

        <p>301.5b An Equipment is cast and enters the battlefield just like any other artifact. An Equipment doesn’t
          enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature
          you control (see rule 702.6, “Equip”). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is
          activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an
          effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that can’t be equipped by it, the Equipment doesn’t move.
        </p>

        <p>301.5c An Equipment that’s also a creature can’t equip a creature. An Equipment that loses the subtype
          “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or
          nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a
          state-based action. See rule 704.) An Equipment can’t equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability
          would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipment’s controller chooses which creature it
          equips.</p>

        <p>301.5d An Equipment’s controller is separate from the equipped creature’s controller; the two need not be the
          same. Changing control of the creature doesn’t change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the
          Equipment’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped
          creature (with “gains” or “has”), the equipped creature’s controller is the only one who can activate that
          ability.</p>

        <p>301.5e An ability of a permanent that refers to the “equipped creature” refers to whatever creature that
          permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Equipment.</p>

        <p>301.6. Some artifacts have the subtype “Fortification.” A Fortification can be attached to a land. It can’t
          legally be attached to an object that isn’t a land. Fortification’s analog to the equip keyword ability is the
          fortify keyword ability. Rules 301.5a–e apply to Fortifications in relation to lands just as they apply to
          Equipment in relation to creatures, with one clarification relating to rule 301.5c: a Fortification that’s
          also a creature (not a land) can’t fortify a land. (See rule 702.66, “Fortify.”)</p>

        <p>301.7. Some artifacts have the subtype “Vehicle.” Vehicles have a crew ability, which allows them to become
          artifact creatures. See rule 702.121, “Crew.”</p>

        <p>301.7a Each Vehicle has a printed power and toughness, but it has these characteristics only if it’s also a
          creature. See rule 208.3.</p>

        <p>301.7b If a Vehicle becomes a creature, it immediately has its printed power and toughness. Other effects,
          including the effect that makes it a creature, may modify these values or set them to different values.</p>

          302. Creatures
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>302.1. A player who has priority may cast a creature card from their hand during a main phase of their turn
          when the stack is empty. Casting a creature as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”)</p>

        <p>302.2. When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>

        <p>302.3. Creature subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Creature — Human
          Soldier,” “Artifact Creature — Golem,” and so on. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Creatures
          may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.</p>
        <p>Example: “Creature — Goblin Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard.</p>

        <p>302.4. Power and toughness are characteristics only creatures have.</p>

        <p>302.4a A creature’s power is the amount of damage it deals in combat.</p>

        <p>302.4b A creature’s toughness is the amount of damage needed to destroy it.</p>

        <p>302.4c To determine a creature’s power and toughness, start with the numbers printed in its lower right
          corner, then apply any applicable continuous effects. (See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”)</p>

        <p>302.5. Creatures can attack and block. (See rule 508, “Declare Attackers Step,” and rule 509, “Declare
          Blockers Step.”)</p>

        <p>302.6. A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap symbol in its activation cost can’t be
          activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent
          turn began. A creature can’t attack unless it has been under its controller’s control continuously since their
          most recent turn began. This rule is informally called the “summoning sickness” rule.</p>

        <p>302.7. Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect is marked on that creature (see
          rule 120.3). If the total damage marked on that creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that
          creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage
          marked on a creature is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.15, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup
          step (see rule 514.2).</p>

        <h2 id="303">
          303. Enchantments
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>303.1. A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from their hand during a main phase of their
          turn when the stack is empty. Casting an enchantment as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting
          Spells.”)</p>

        <p>303.2. When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
        </p>

        <p>303.3. Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Enchantment —
          Shrine.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment
          types. Enchantments may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3h for the complete list of enchantment types.
        </p>

        <p>303.4. Some enchantments have the subtype “Aura.” An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an object or
          player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5, “Enchant”).
          Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.</p>

        <p>303.4a An Aura spell requires a target, which is defined by its enchant ability.</p>

        <p>303.4b The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted. The Aura is attached to, or
          “enchants,” that object or player.</p>

        <p>303.4c If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player as defined by its enchant ability and other
          applicable effects, the object it was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has left
          the game, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>303.4d An Aura can’t enchant itself. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. An
          Aura that’s also a creature can’t enchant anything. If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached, then
          is put into its owner’s graveyard. (These are state-based actions. See rule 704.) An Aura can’t enchant more
          than one object or player. If a spell or ability would cause an Aura to become attached to more than one
          object or player, the Aura’s controller chooses which object or player it becomes attached to.</p>

        <p>303.4e An Aura’s controller is separate from the enchanted object’s controller or the enchanted player; the
          two need not be the same. If an Aura enchants an object, changing control of the object doesn’t change control
          of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Aura’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Aura
          grants an ability to the enchanted object (with “gains” or “has”), the enchanted object’s controller is the
          only one who can activate that ability.</p>

        <p>303.4f If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a player’s control by any means other than by resolving
          as an Aura spell, and the effect putting it onto the battlefield doesn’t specify the object or player the Aura
          will enchant, that player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the battlefield. The player must
          choose a legal object or player according to the Aura’s enchant ability and any other applicable effects.</p>

        <p>303.4g If an Aura is entering the battlefield and there is no legal object or player for it to enchant, the
          Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its
          owner’s graveyard instead of entering the battlefield.</p>

        <p>303.4h If an effect attempts to put a permanent that isn’t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification onto the
          battlefield attached to an object or player, it enters the battlefield unattached.</p>

        <p>303.4i If an effect attempts to put an Aura onto the battlefield attached to an object or player it can’t
          legally enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura
          is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn’t
          created.</p>

        <p>303.4j If an effect attempts to attach an Aura on the battlefield to an object or player it can’t legally
          enchant, the Aura doesn’t move.</p>

        <p>303.4k If an effect allows an Aura that’s being turned face up to become attached to an object or player, the
          Aura’s controller considers the characteristics of that Aura as it would exist if it were face up to determine
          what it may be attached to, and they must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura’s enchant
          ability and any other applicable effects.</p>

        <p>303.4m An ability of a permanent that refers to the “enchanted [object or player]” refers to whatever object
          or player that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Aura.</p>

        <p>303.5. Some enchantments have the subtype “Saga.” See rule 714 for more information about Saga cards.</p>

        <h2 id="304">
          304. Instants
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>304.1. A player who has priority may cast an instant card from their hand. Casting an instant as a spell uses
          the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”)</p>

        <p>304.2. When an instant spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then it’s put into
          its owner’s graveyard.</p>

        <p>304.3. Instant subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Instant — Arcane.” Each
          word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of instant subtypes is the same as the set of sorcery
          subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Instants may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3k for the
          complete list of spell types.</p>

        <p>304.4. Instants can’t enter the battlefield. If an instant would enter the battlefield, it remains in its
          previous zone instead.</p>

        <p>304.5. If text states that a player may do something “any time they could cast an instant,” it means only
          that the player must have priority. The player doesn’t need to have an instant they could cast. Effects that
          would preclude that player from casting a spell or casting an instant don’t affect the player’s capability to
          perform that action (unless the action is actually casting a spell or casting an instant).</p>

        <h2 id="305">
          305. Lands
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>305.1. A player who has priority may play a land card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when
          the stack is empty. Playing a land is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116). Rather, the
          player simply puts the land onto the battlefield. Since the land doesn’t go on the stack, it is never a spell,
          and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities.</p>

        <p>305.2. A player can normally play one land during their turn; however, continuous effects may increase this
          number.</p>

        <p>305.2a To determine whether a player can play a land, compare the number of lands the player can play this
          turn with the number of lands they have already played this turn (including lands played as special actions
          and lands played during the resolution of spells and abilities). If the number of lands the player can play is
          greater, the play is legal.</p>

        <p>305.2b A player can’t play a land, for any reason, if the number of lands the player can play this turn is
          equal to or less than the number of lands they have already played this turn. Ignore any part of an effect
          that instructs a player to do so.</p>

        <p>305.3. A player can’t play a land, for any reason, if it isn’t their turn. Ignore any part of an effect that
          instructs a player to do so.</p>

        <p>305.4. Effects may also allow players to “put” lands onto the battlefield. This isn’t the same as “playing a
          land” and doesn’t count as a land played during the current turn.</p>

        <p>305.5. Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called
          land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3i for the complete list of land types.</p>
        <p>Example: “Basic Land — Mountain” means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain.</p>

        <p>305.6. The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words
          “basic land type,” it’s referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land
          type has the intrinsic ability “{T}: Add [mana symbol],” even if the text box doesn’t actually contain that
          text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is {W}; for Islands, {U}; for Swamps, {B}; for
          Mountains, {R}; and for Forests, {G}. See rule 107.4a. See also rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”</p>

        <p>305.7. If an effect sets a land’s subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its
          old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copy effects
          affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this
          doesn’t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a land’s subtype doesn’t
          add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land
          may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules
          text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.</p>

        <p>305.8. Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a
          nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.</p>

        <p>305.9. If an object is both a land and another card type, it can be played only as a land. It can’t be cast
          as a spell.</p>

        <h2 id="306">
          306. Planeswalkers
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>306.1. A player who has priority may cast a planeswalker card from their hand during a main phase of their
          turn when the stack is empty. Casting a planeswalker as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting
          Spells.”)</p>

        <p>306.2. When a planeswalker spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
        </p>

        <p>306.3. Planeswalker subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Planeswalker —
          Jace.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Planeswalker subtypes are also called planeswalker
          types. Planeswalkers may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3j for the complete list of planeswalker types.
        </p>

        <p>306.4. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a “planeswalker uniqueness rule” that stopped a player from
          controlling two planeswalkers of the same planeswalker type. This rule has been removed and planeswalker cards
          printed before this change have received errata in the Oracle card reference to have the legendary supertype.
          Like other legendary permanents, they are subject to the “legend rule” (see rule 704.5j).</p>

        <p>306.5. Loyalty is a characteristic only planeswalkers have.</p>

        <p>306.5a The loyalty of a planeswalker card not on the battlefield is equal to the number printed in its lower
          right corner.</p>

        <p>306.5b A planeswalker has the intrinsic ability “This permanent enters the battlefield with a number of
          loyalty counters on it equal to its printed loyalty number.” This ability creates a replacement effect (see
          rule 614.1c).</p>

        <p>306.5c The loyalty of a planeswalker on the battlefield is equal to the number of loyalty counters on it.</p>

        <p>306.5d Each planeswalker has a number of loyalty abilities, which are activated abilities with loyalty
          symbols in their costs. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a
          permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn,
          but only if none of that permanent’s loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, “Loyalty
          Abilities.”</p>

        <p>306.6. Planeswalkers can be attacked. (See rule 508, “Declare Attackers Step.”)</p>

        <p>306.7. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a redirection effect that allowed a player to have noncombat
          damage that would be dealt to an opponent be dealt to a planeswalker under that opponent’s control instead.
          This rule has been removed and certain cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to deal damage
          directly to planeswalkers.</p>

        <p>306.8. Damage dealt to a planeswalker results in that many loyalty counters being removed from it.</p>

        <p>306.9. If a planeswalker’s loyalty is 0, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based action.
          See rule 704.)</p>

        <h2 id="307">
          307. Sorceries
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>307.1. A player who has priority may cast a sorcery card from their hand during a main phase of their turn
          when the stack is empty. Casting a sorcery as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”)</p>

        <p>307.2. When a sorcery spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then it’s put into
          its owner’s graveyard.</p>

        <p>307.3. Sorcery subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Sorcery — Arcane.” Each
          word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of sorcery subtypes is the same as the set of instant
          subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Sorceries may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3k for the
          complete list of spell types.</p>

        <p>307.4. Sorceries can’t enter the battlefield. If a sorcery would enter the battlefield, it remains in its
          previous zone instead.</p>

        <p>307.5. If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something only “any time they could cast a
          sorcery,” it means only that the player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of their turn,
          and the stack must be empty. The player doesn’t need to have a sorcery they could cast. Effects that would
          preclude that player from casting a spell or casting a sorcery don’t affect the player’s capability to perform
          that action (unless the action is actually casting a spell or casting a sorcery).</p>

        <p>307.5a Similarly, if an effect checks to see if a spell was cast “any time a sorcery couldn’t have been
          cast,” it’s checking only whether the spell’s controller cast it without having priority, during a phase other
          than their main phase, or while another object was on the stack.</p>

          <section class="main-section" id="4._zones">
        
          <header><h1>4. Zones</h1></header>
        

        <h2 id="400">
          400. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>400.1. A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand,
          battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Each player has
          their own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.</p>

        <p>400.2. Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cards’ faces, except for those cards that some
          rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are
          public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cards’ faces. Library
          and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.</p>

        <p>400.3. If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its owner’s, it goes to its
          owner’s corresponding zone.</p>

        <p>400.4. Cards with certain card types can’t enter certain zones.</p>

        <p>400.4a If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone.</p>

        <p>400.4b If a conspiracy, phenomenon, plane, scheme, or vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains
          in the command zone.</p>

        <p>400.5. The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can’t be changed except when
          effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other
          objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether
          they’re tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.</p>

        <p>400.6. If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the
          object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it
          to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each
          other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects,
          whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try
          to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object’s
          controller—or its owner if it has no controller—chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does.
          (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous
          “destroy” effects.) Then the event moves the object.</p>
        <p>Example: Exquisite Archangel has an ability which reads “If you would lose the game, instead exile Exquisite
          Archangel and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total.” A spell deals 5 damage to a player
          with 5 life and 5 damage to an Exquisite Archangel under that player’s control. As state-based actions are
          performed, that player’s life total becomes equal to their starting life total, and that player chooses
          whether Exquisite Archangel moves to its owner’s graveyard or to exile.</p>

        <p>400.7. An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to,
          its previous existence. There are nine exceptions to this rule:</p>

        <p>400.7a Effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities that change the characteristics or
          controller of a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to the permanent that spell becomes.</p>

        <p>400.7b Prevention effects that apply to damage from a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to
          damage from the permanent that spell becomes.</p>

        <p>400.7c An ability of a permanent can reference information about the spell that became that permanent as it
          resolved, including what costs were paid to cast that spell or what mana was spent to pay those costs.</p>

        <p>400.7d Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, “When Rancor is put
          into a graveyard from the battlefield”) can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved to when
          the ability triggered, if that zone is a public zone.</p>

        <p>400.7e Abilities of Auras that trigger when the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield can find the new
          object that Aura became in its owner’s graveyard if it was put into that graveyard at the same time the
          enchanted permanent left the battlefield. It can also find the new object that Aura became in its owner’s
          graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not being attached to a permanent. (See
          rule 704.5m.)</p>

        <p>400.7f If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be cast, that ability will continue to
          apply to the new object that card became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>

        <p>400.7g If an effect allows a nonland card to be cast, other parts of that effect can find the new object that
          card becomes after it moves to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>

        <p>400.7h If an effect causes an object to move to a public zone, other parts of that effect can find that
          object. If the cost of a spell or ability causes an object to move to a public zone, that spell or ability’s
          effects can find that object.</p>

        <p>400.7i After resolving a madness triggered ability (see rule 702.34), if the exiled card wasn’t cast and was
          moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that object.</p>

        <p>400.8. If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesn’t change zones, but it becomes a new object that
          has just been exiled.</p>

        <p>400.9. If a face-up object in the command zone is turned face down, it becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>400.10. If an object in the command zone is put into the command zone, it doesn’t change zones, but it
          becomes a new object that has just entered the command zone.</p>

        <p>400.11. An object is outside the game if it isn’t in any of the game’s zones. Outside the game is not a zone.
        </p>

        <p>400.11a Cards in a player’s sideboard are outside the game. See rule 100.4.</p>

        <p>400.11b Some effects bring cards into a game from outside of it. Those cards remain in the game until it
          ends.</p>

        <p>400.11c Cards outside the game can’t be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining
          abilities printed on them (see rule 604.3) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into
          the game.</p>

        <p>400.12. Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such as “Shuffle your hand into your
          library”). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.</p>

        <h2 id="401">
          401. Library
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>401.1. When a game begins, each player’s deck becomes their library.</p>

        <p>401.2. Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players can’t look at or change the order of
          cards in a library.</p>

        <p>401.3. Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player’s library at any time.</p>

        <p>401.4. If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a library at the same time, the owner of
          those cards may arrange them in any order. That library’s owner doesn’t reveal the order in which the cards go
          into the library.</p>

        <p>401.5. Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, or say that a player
          may look at the top card of their library. If the top card of the player’s library changes while a spell is
          being cast, the new top card won’t be revealed and can’t be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule
          601.2i). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated.</p>

        <p>401.6. If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, and that particular
          card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>401.7. If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library “Nth from the top,” and that library has
          fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.</p>

        <h2 id="402">
          402. Hand
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>402.1. The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a player’s hand by
          other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that
          player’s starting hand size, normally seven. (See rule 103, “Starting the Game.”)</p>

        <p>402.2. Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of
          cards in their hand, but as part of their cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the
          maximum hand size.</p>

        <p>402.3. A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player can’t
          look at the cards in another player’s hand but may count those cards at any time.</p>

        <h2 id="403">
          403. Battlefield
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>403.1. Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty.
          Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of them on the battlefield, though there are some
          cases (such as an Aura attached to another player’s permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept
          closer to a different player.</p>

        <p>403.2. A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or
          another zone.</p>

        <p>403.3. Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule
          110, “Permanents.”</p>

        <p>403.4. Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any
          previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule 400.7. (This is also true
          for any objects entering any zone.)</p>

        <p>403.5. Previously, the battlefield was called the “in-play zone.” Cards that were printed with text that
          contains the phrases “in play,” “from play,” “into play,” or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards
          that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.</p>

        <h2 id="404">
          404. Graveyard
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>404.1. A player’s graveyard is their discard pile. Any object that’s countered, discarded, destroyed, or
          sacrificed is put on top of its owner’s graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that’s finished
          resolving. Each player’s graveyard starts out empty.</p>

        <p>404.2. Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at
          any time but normally can’t change their order. Additional rules applying to sanctioned tournaments may allow
          a player to change the order of cards in their graveyard.</p>

        <p>404.3. If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of
          those cards may arrange them in any order.</p>

        <h2 id="405">
          405. Stack
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>405.1. When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule 601.2a). When an ability is
          activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules 602.2a and
          603.3).</p>

        <p>405.2. The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object
          is put on the stack, it’s put on top of all objects already there.</p>

        <p>405.3. If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active
          player are put on lowest, followed by each other player’s objects in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). If a player
          controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.</p>

        <p>405.4. Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered
          ability that’s on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The
          controller of a spell is the person who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who
          activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it
          triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered
          ability, see rules 603.7d–f.</p>

        <p>405.5. When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If
          the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.</p>

        <p>405.6. Some things that happen during the game don’t use the stack.</p>

        <p>405.6a Effects don’t go on the stack; they’re the result of spells and abilities resolving. Effects may
          create delayed triggered abilities, however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see rule 603.7).
        </p>

        <p>405.6b Static abilities continuously generate effects and don’t go on the stack. (See rule 604, “Handling
          Static Abilities.”) This includes characteristic-defining abilities such as “[This object] is red” (see rule
          604.3).</p>

        <p>405.6c Mana abilities resolve immediately. If a mana ability both produces mana and has another effect, the
          mana is produced and the other effect happens immediately. If a player had priority before a mana ability was
          activated, that player gets priority after it resolves. (See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”)</p>

        <p>405.6d Special actions don’t use the stack; they happen immediately. See rule 116, “Special Actions.”</p>

        <p>405.6e Turn-based actions don’t use the stack; they happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin.
          They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority (see rule 117.3a). Turn-based actions also happen
          automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule 703.</p>

        <p>405.6f State-based actions don’t use the stack; they happen automatically when certain conditions are met.
          See rule 704. They are dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule 117.5.</p>

        <p>405.6g A player may concede the game at any time. That player leaves the game immediately. See rule 104.3a.
        </p>

        <p>405.6h If a player leaves a multiplayer game, objects may leave the game, cease to exist, change control, or
          be exiled as a result. These actions happen immediately. See rule 800.4a.</p>

        <h2 id="406">
          406. Exile
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>406.1. The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object
          without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only
          temporarily.</p>

        <p>406.2. To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone it’s currently in. An exiled
          card is a card that’s been put into the exile zone.</p>

        <p>406.3. Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards
          “exiled face down” can’t be examined by any player except when instructions allow it. However, once a player
          is allowed to look at a card exiled face down, that player may continue to look at that card as long as it
          remains exiled, even if the instruction allowing the player to do so no longer applies. A card exiled face
          down has no characteristics, but the spell or ability that exiled it may allow it to be played from exile.
          Unless that card is being cast face down (see rule 707.4), the card is turned face up just before the player
          announces that they are playing the card (see rule 601.2).</p>

        <p>406.4. Face-down cards in exile should be kept in separate piles based on when they were exiled and how they
          were exiled. If a player is instructed to choose an exiled card, the player may choose a specific face-down
          card only if the player is allowed to look at that card. Otherwise, they may choose a pile of face-down exiled
          cards, and then a card is chosen at random from within that pile. If choosing such a card is part of casting a
          spell or activating an ability, the chosen card isn’t revealed until after that cost is fully paid. (See rule
          601.2i.)</p>

        <p>406.5. Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles
          to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to
          their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise
          be kept in separate piles.</p>

        <p>406.6. An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another
          ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are
          linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule 607, “Linked
          Abilities.”</p>

        <p>406.7. If an object in the exile zone becomes exiled, it doesn’t change zones, but it becomes a new object
          that has just been exiled.</p>

        <p>406.8. Previously, the exile zone was called the “removed-from-the-game zone.” Cards that were printed with
          text that “removes [an object] from the game” exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text
          that “sets [an object] aside.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card
          reference.</p>

        <h2 id="407">
          407. Ante
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>407.1. Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing “for keeps.” Playing
          Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and it’s allowed only where it’s not
          forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering
          Tournament Rules (WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents).</p>

        <p>407.2. When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from their deck into the ante zone after
          determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards. Cards in the ante zone may be examined
          by any player at any time. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in the ante
          zone.</p>

        <p>407.3. A few cards have the text “Remove [this card] from your deck before playing if you’re not playing for
          ante.” These are the only cards that can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a card’s owner. When
          not playing for ante, players can’t include these cards in their decks or sideboards, and these cards can’t be
          brought into the game from outside the game.</p>

        <p>407.4. To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from whichever zone it’s currently in. The
          owner of an object is the only person who can ante that object.</p>

          408. Command
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>408.1. The command zone is a game area reserved for certain specialized objects that have an overarching
          effect on the game, yet are not permanents and cannot be destroyed.</p>

        <p>408.2. Emblems may be created in the command zone. See rule 114, “Emblems.”</p>

        <p>408.3. In the Planechase, Vanguard, Commander, Archenemy, and Conspiracy Draft casual variants,
          nontraditional Magic cards and/or specially designated cards start the game in the command zone. Each variant
          has its own rules regarding such cards. See section 9, “Casual Variants.”</p>

          500. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>500.1. A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and
          ending. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning,
          combat, and ending phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.</p>

        <p>500.2. A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in
          succession. Simply having the stack become empty doesn’t cause such a phase or step to end; all players have
          to pass in succession with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to
          the stack before that phase or step ends.</p>

        <p>500.3. A step in which no players receive priority ends when all specified actions that take place during
          that step are completed. The only such steps are the untap step (see rule 502) and certain cleanup steps (see
          rule 514).</p>

        <p>500.4. When a step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a player’s mana pool empties. This turn-based
          action doesn’t use the stack.</p>

        <p>500.5. When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last “until end of” that phase or step expire.
          When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last “until” that phase or step expire. Effects that
          last “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase, not at the beginning of the end of combat
          step. Effects that last “until end of turn” are subject to special rules; see rule 514.2.</p>

        <p>500.6. When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step
          trigger. They are put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and
          Priority.”)</p>

        <p>500.7. Some effects can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the
          specified turn. If a player is given multiple extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time. If
          multiple players are given extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time, in APNAP order (see rule
          101.4). The most recently created turn will be taken first.</p>

        <p>500.8. Some effects can add phases to a turn. They do this by adding the phases directly after the specified
          phase. If multiple extra phases are created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur
          first.</p>

        <p>500.9. Some effects can add steps to a phase. They do this by adding the steps directly after a specified
          step or directly before a specified step. If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most
          recently created step will occur first.</p>

        <p>500.10. Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped. To skip a step, phase, or turn is to
          proceed past it as though it didn’t exist. See rule 614.10.</p>

        <p>500.11. No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps.</p>

        <h2 id="501">
          501. Beginning Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>501.1. The beginning phase consists of three steps, in this order: untap, upkeep, and draw.</p>

        <h2 id="502">
          502. Untap Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>502.1. First, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all
          phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens
          simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. See rule 702.25, “Phasing.”</p>

        <p>502.2. Second, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them
          all simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Normally, all of a player’s permanents
          untap, but effects can keep one or more of a player’s permanents from untapping.</p>

        <p>502.3. No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells can be cast or resolve and no
          abilities can be activated or resolve. Any ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next
          time a player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep step. (See rule 503, “Upkeep Step.”)

        <hr>

        <p>503.1. The upkeep step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule
          117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>503.1a Any abilities that triggered during the untap step and any abilities that triggered at the beginning
          of the upkeep are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered
          doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</p>

        <p>503.2. If a spell states that it may be cast only “after [a player’s] upkeep step,” and the turn has multiple
          upkeep steps, that spell may be cast any time after the first upkeep step ends.</p>

        <p>504.1. First, the active player draws a card. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>

        <p>504.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <h2 id="505">
          505. Main Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>505.1. There are two main phases in a turn. In each turn, the first main phase (also known as the precombat
          main phase) and the second main phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the combat
          phase (see rule 506, “Combat Phase”). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and
          collectively known as the main phase.</p>

        <p>505.1a Only the first main phase of the turn is a precombat main phase. All other main phases are postcombat
          main phases. This includes the second main phase of a turn in which the combat phase has been skipped. It is
          also true of a turn in which an effect has caused an additional combat phase and an additional main phase to
          be created.</p>

        <p>505.2. The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players pass in succession while the stack
          is empty. (See rule 500.2.)</p>

        <p>505.3. First, but only if the players are playing an Archenemy game (see rule 904), the active player is the
          archenemy, and it’s the active player’s precombat main phase, the active player sets the top card of their
          scheme deck in motion (see rule 701.25). This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>

        <p>505.4. Second, if the active player controls one or more Saga enchantments and it’s the active player’s
          precombat main phase, the active player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control. (See rule 714, “Saga
          Cards.”) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>

        <p>505.5. Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>505.5a The main phase is the only phase in which a player can normally cast artifact, creature, enchantment,
          planeswalker, and sorcery spells. The active player may cast these spells.</p>

        <p>505.5b During either main phase, the active player may play one land card from their hand if the stack is
          empty, if the player has priority, and if they haven’t played a land this turn (unless an effect states the
          player may play additional lands). This action doesn’t use the stack. Neither the land nor the action of
          playing the land is a spell or ability, so it can’t be countered, and players can’t respond to it with
          instants or activated abilities. (See rule 305, “Lands.”)</p>

        <h2 id="506">
          506. Combat Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>506.1. The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers,
          declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped
          if no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking (see rule 508.8). There are
          two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double
          strike (see rule 702.4).</p>

        <p>506.2. During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player; creatures that player controls may
          attack. During the combat phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that
          player and planeswalkers they control may be attacked.</p>

        <p>506.2a During the combat phase of a multiplayer game, there may be one or more defending players, depending
          on the variant being played and the options chosen for it. Unless all the attacking player’s opponents
          automatically become defending players during the combat phase, the attacking player chooses one of their
          opponents as a turn-based action during the beginning of combat step. (Note that the choice may be dictated by
          the variant being played or the options chosen for it.) That player becomes the defending player. See rule
          802, “Attack Multiple Players Option,” rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 809,
          “Emperor Variant.”</p>

        <p>506.2b In multiplayer games using the shared team turns option, the active team is the attacking team and the
          nonactive team is the defending team. See rule 805, “Shared Team Turns Option.”</p>

        <p>506.3. Only a creature can attack or block. Only a player or a planeswalker can be attacked.</p>

        <p>506.3a If an effect would put a noncreature permanent onto the battlefield attacking or blocking, the
          permanent does enter the battlefield but it’s never considered to be an attacking or blocking permanent.</p>

        <p>506.3b If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking under the control of any player
          except an attacking player, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be an
          attacking creature.</p>

        <p>506.3c If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking either a player not in the game or a
          planeswalker no longer on the battlefield or no longer a planeswalker, that creature does enter the
          battlefield, but it’s never considered to be an attacking creature.</p>

        <p>506.3d If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield blocking but the creature it would block isn’t
          attacking either the first creature’s controller or a planeswalker that player controls, that creature does
          enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be a blocking creature.</p>

        <p>506.4. A permanent is removed from combat if it leaves the battlefield, if its controller changes, if it
          phases out, if an effect specifically removes it from combat, if it’s a planeswalker that’s being attacked and
          stops being a planeswalker, or if it’s an attacking or blocking creature that regenerates (see rule 701.15) or
          stops being a creature. A creature that’s removed from combat stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked,
          and/or unblocked creature. A planeswalker that’s removed from combat stops being attacked.</p>

        <p>506.4a Once a creature has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature, spells or abilities that would
          have kept that creature from attacking or blocking don’t remove the creature from combat.</p>

        <p>506.4b Tapping or untapping a creature that’s already been declared as an attacker or blocker doesn’t remove
          it from combat and doesn’t prevent its combat damage.</p>

        <p>506.4c If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, removing that planeswalker from combat doesn’t remove that
          creature from combat. It continues to be an attacking creature, although it is attacking neither a player nor
          a planeswalker. It may be blocked. If it is unblocked, it will deal no combat damage.</p>

        <p>506.4d A permanent that’s both a blocking creature and a planeswalker that’s being attacked is removed from
          combat if it stops being both a creature and a planeswalker. If it stops being one of those card types but
          continues to be the other, it continues to be either a blocking creature or a planeswalker that’s being
          attacked, whichever is appropriate.</p>

        <p>506.5. A creature attacks alone if it’s the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare
          attackers step. A creature is attacking alone if it’s attacking but no other creatures are. A creature blocks
          alone if it’s the only creature declared as a blocker during the declare blockers step. A creature is blocking
          alone if it’s blocking but no other creatures are.</p>

        <p>506.6. Some spells state that they may be cast “only [before/after] [a particular point in the combat
          phase],” in which that point may be “attackers are declared,” “blockers are declared,” “the combat damage
          step,” “the end of combat step,” “the combat phase,” or “combat.”</p>

        <p>506.6a A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) attackers are declared” is referring to the
          turn-based action of declaring attackers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare attackers step
          begins, regardless of whether any attackers are actually declared. (See rule 508.)</p>

        <p>506.6b A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) blockers are declared” is referring to the
          turn-based action of declaring blockers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare blockers step
          begins, regardless of whether any blockers are actually declared. (See rule 509.)</p>

        <p>506.6c Some spells state that they may be cast only “during combat” or “during a certain player’s combat
          phase” in addition to the criteria described in rule 506.6. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells
          may be cast at an appropriate time during any of them.</p>

        <p>506.6d Some spells state that they may be cast “only before (or after) [a particular point in the combat
          phase],” but don’t meet the additional criteria described in rule 506.6c. If a turn has multiple combat
          phases, such spells may be cast that turn only before (or after) the stated point of the first combat phase.
        </p>

        <p>506.6e If a spell states that it may be cast “only before [a particular point in the combat phase],” but the
          stated point doesn’t exist within the relevant combat phase because the declare blockers step and the combat
          damage step are skipped (see rule 508.8), then the spell may be cast only before the declare attackers step
          ends. If the stated point doesn’t exist because the relevant combat phase has been skipped, then the spell may
          be cast only before the precombat main phase ends.</p>

        <p>506.6f If a spell states that it may be cast “only during combat after blockers are declared,” but the
          declare blockers step is skipped that combat phase (see rule 508.8), then the spell may not be cast during
          that combat phase.</p>

        <p>506.6g Rules 506.6 and 506.6a–f apply to abilities that state that they may be activated only at certain
          times with respect to combat just as they apply to spells that state that they may be cast only at certain
          times with respect to combat.</p>

          507. Beginning of Combat Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>507.1. First, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the active player’s opponents don’t all
          automatically become defending players, the active player chooses one of their opponents. That player becomes
          the defending player. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. (See rule 506.2.)</p>

        <p>507.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <h2 id="508">
          508. Declare Attackers Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>508.1. First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To declare
          attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of
          attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is
          illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 723, “Handling Illegal Actions”).</p>

        <p>508.1a The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures
          must be untapped, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player
          continuously since the turn began.</p>

        <p>508.1b If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, or the game allows the active player to attack
          multiple other players, the active player announces which player or planeswalker each of the chosen creatures
          is attacking.</p>

        <p>508.1c The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions
          (effects that say a creature can’t attack, or that it can’t attack unless some condition is met). If any
          restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states “[This creature] can’t attack
          alone.” It’s legal to declare both as attackers.</p>

        <p>508.1d The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any requirements
          (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of
          requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be
          obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature can’t
          attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that
          creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks
          if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able
          during each declare attackers step in that turn.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls two creatures: one that “attacks if able” and one with no abilities. An effect
          states “No more than one creature can attack each turn.” The only legal attack is for just the creature that
          “attacks if able” to attack. It’s illegal to attack with the other creature, attack with both, or attack with
          neither.</p>

        <p>508.1e If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a “bands with other” ability, the active player
          announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule 702.21, “Banding.”)</p>

        <p>508.1f The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when it’s declared as an attacker
          isn’t a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.</p>

        <p>508.1g If there are any optional costs to attack with the chosen creatures (expressed as costs a player may
          pay “as” a creature attacks), the active player chooses which, if any, they will pay.</p>

        <p>508.1h If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, or if any optional costs to attack were
          chosen, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping
          permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes
          “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.</p>

        <p>508.1i If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see
          rule 605, “Mana Abilities”).</p>

        <p>508.1j Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments
          are not allowed.</p>

        <p>508.1k Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes an attacking creature. It remains
          an attacking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule
          506.4.</p>

        <p>508.1m Any abilities that trigger on attackers being declared trigger.</p>

        <p>508.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>508.2a Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as
          an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creature’s characteristics change to
          match the ability’s trigger condition.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent has the ability “Whenever a green creature attacks, destroy that creature at end of
          combat.” If a blue creature attacks and is later turned green, the ability will not trigger.</p>

        <p>508.2b Any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared or that triggered during the process
          described in rules 508.1 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which
          they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</p>

        <p>508.3. Triggered abilities that trigger on attackers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
        </p>

        <p>508.3a An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks, . . .” triggers if that creature is declared as
          an attacker. Similarly, “Whenever [a creature] attacks [a player or planeswalker], . . .” triggers if that
          creature is declared as an attacker attacking that player or planeswalker. Such abilities won’t trigger if a
          creature is put onto the battlefield attacking.</p>

        <p>508.3b An ability that reads “Whenever [a player or planeswalker] is attacked, . . .” triggers if one or more
          creatures are declared as attackers attacking that player or planeswalker. It won’t trigger if a creature is
          put onto the battlefield attacking that player or planeswalker.</p>

        <p>508.3c An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks with [a creature], . . .” triggers whenever a
          creature that player controls is declared as an attacker.</p>

        <p>508.3d An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers during the
          declare blockers step, not the declare attackers step. See rule 509.5g.</p>

        <p>508.4. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or
          which planeswalker a defending player controls it’s attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect
          that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a
          creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player
          controls it’s attacking it becomes attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are
          “attacking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never “attacked.”</p>

        <p>508.4a If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield attacking specifies it’s attacking a certain
          player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature is put onto the
          battlefield but is never considered an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature
          is put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield or
          is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.</p>

        <p>508.4b If the effect that states a creature is attacking specifies it’s attacking a certain player, and that
          player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature doesn’t become an attacking creature.
          The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no
          longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.</p>

        <p>508.4c A creature that’s put onto the battlefield attacking or that is stated to be attacking isn’t affected
          by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.</p>

        <p>508.5. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to
          both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s
          referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is
          attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that
          creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature
          was attacking before it was removed from combat.</p>

        <p>508.5a In a multiplayer game, any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one
          specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple
          attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking
          creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or
          ability chooses one.</p>

        <p>508.6. A player is “attacking [a player]” if the first player controls a creature that is attacking the
          second player. A player has “attacked [a player]” if the first player declared one or more creatures as
          attackers attacking the second player.</p>

        <p>508.7. One card (Portal Mage) allows a player to reselect which player or planeswalker a creature is
          attacking.</p>

        <p>508.7a The attacking creature isn’t removed from combat and it isn’t considered to have attacked a second
          time. That creature is attacking the reselected player or planeswalker, but it’s still considered to have
          attacked the player or planeswalker chosen as it was declared as an attacker.</p>

        <p>508.7b While reselecting which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking, that creature isn’t affected
          by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.</p>

        <p>508.7c The reselected player or planeswalker must be an opponent of the attacking creature’s controller, or a
          planeswalker controlled by an opponent of the attacking creature’s controller.</p>

        <p>508.7d In a multiplayer game not using the attack multiple players option (see rule 802), the reselected
          player or planeswalker must be the chosen defending player or a planeswalker controlled by that player.</p>

        <p>508.7e In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801), the reselected
          player or planeswalker must be within the range of influence of the attacking creature’s controller.</p>

        <p>508.8. If no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking, skip the declare
          blockers and combat damage steps.</p>

        <h2 id="509">
          509. Declare Blockers Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>509.1. First, the defending player declares blockers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To
          declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the
          declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the
          declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 723, “Handling Illegal
          Actions”).</p>

        <p>509.1a The defending player chooses which creatures they control, if any, will block. The chosen creatures
          must be untapped. For each of the chosen creatures, the defending player chooses one creature for it to block
          that’s attacking that player or a planeswalker they control.</p>

        <p>509.1b The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any
          restrictions (effects that say a creature can’t block, or that it can’t block unless some condition is met).
          If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of blockers is illegal.</p>
        <p>A restriction may be created by an evasion ability (a static ability an attacking creature has that restricts
          what can block it). If an attacking creature gains or loses an evasion ability after a legal block has been
          declared, it doesn’t affect that block. Different evasion abilities are cumulative.</p>
        <p>Example: An attacking creature with flying and shadow can’t be blocked by a creature with flying but without
          shadow.</p>

        <p>509.1c The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any
          requirements (effects that say a creature must block, or that it must block if some condition is met). If the
          number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that
          could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal. If a creature
          can’t block unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if blocking with
          that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature
          blocks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature blocks if able
          during each declare blockers step in that turn.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls one creature that “blocks if able” and another creature with no abilities. If a
          creature with menace attacks that player, the player must block with both creatures. Having only the first
          creature block violates the restriction created by menace (the attacking creature can’t be blocked except by
          two or more creatures). Having only the second creature block violates both the menace restriction and the
          first creature’s blocking requirement. Having neither creature block fulfills the restriction but not the
          requirement.</p>

        <p>509.1d If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to block, the defending player determines the
          total cost to block. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding
          cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total
          cost after this time, ignore this change.</p>

        <p>509.1e If any of the costs require mana, the defending player then has a chance to activate mana abilities
          (see rule 605, “Mana Abilities”).</p>

        <p>509.1f Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments
          are not allowed.</p>

        <p>509.1g Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player becomes a blocking creature. Each one is
          blocking the attacking creatures chosen for it. It remains a blocking creature until it’s removed from combat
          or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 506.4.</p>

        <p>509.1h An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked
          creature; one with no creatures declared as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature. This remains
          unchanged until the creature is removed from combat, an effect says that it becomes blocked or unblocked, or
          the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. A creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it
          are removed from combat.</p>

        <p>509.1i Any abilities that trigger on blockers being declared trigger. See rule 509.4 for more information.
        </p>

        <p>509.2. Second, for each attacking creature that’s become blocked, the active player announces that creature’s
          damage assignment order, which consists of the creatures blocking it in an order of that player’s choice.
          (During the combat damage step, an attacking creature can’t assign combat damage to a creature that’s blocking
          it unless each creature ahead of that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This
          turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>
        <p>Example: Vastwood Gorger is blocked by Llanowar Elves, Runeclaw Bear, and Serra Angel. Vastwood Gorger’s
          controller announces the Vastwood Gorger’s damage assignment order as Serra Angel, then Llanowar Elves, then
          Runeclaw Bear.</p>

        <p>509.2a During the declare blockers step, if a blocking creature is removed from combat or a spell or ability
          causes it to stop blocking an attacking creature, the blocking creature is removed from all relevant damage
          assignment orders. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged.</p>

        <p>509.3. Third, for each blocking creature, the defending player announces that creature’s damage assignment
          order, which consists of the creatures it’s blocking in an order of that player’s choice. (During the combat
          damage step, a blocking creature can’t assign combat damage to a creature it’s blocking unless each creature
          ahead of that blocked creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This turn-based action doesn’t use the
          stack.</p>

        <p>509.3a During the declare blockers step, if an attacking creature is removed from combat or a spell or
          ability causes it to stop being blocked by a blocking creature, the attacking creature is removed from all
          relevant damage assignment orders. The relative order among the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged.
        </p>

        <p>509.4. Fourth, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>509.4a Any abilities that triggered on blockers being declared or that triggered during the process described
          in rules 509.1–3 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they
          triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</p>

        <p>509.5. Triggered abilities that trigger on blockers being declared may have different trigger conditions.</p>

        <p>509.5a An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks, . . .” generally triggers only once each combat
          for that creature, even if it blocks multiple creatures. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker.
          It will also trigger if that creature becomes a blocker as the result of an effect, but only if it wasn’t a
          blocking creature at that time. (See rule 509.1g.) It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the
          battlefield blocking.</p>

        <p>509.5b An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .” triggers once for each
          attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker.
          It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t
          already blocking that attacking creature at that time. It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the
          battlefield blocking.</p>

        <p>509.5c An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked, . . .” generally triggers only once each
          combat for that creature, even if it’s blocked by multiple creatures. It will trigger if that creature becomes
          blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked
          by an effect or by a creature that’s put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature
          was an unblocked creature at that time. (See rule 509.1h.)</p>

        <p>509.5d An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked by a creature, . . .” triggers once for
          each creature that blocks the named creature. It triggers if a creature is declared as a blocker for the
          attacking creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but
          only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. In addition, it will trigger if a
          creature is put onto the battlefield blocking that creature. It won’t trigger if the creature becomes blocked
          by an effect rather than a creature.</p>

        <p>509.5e If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures,
          the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared.
          Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to trigger. This applies to abilities that
          trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.</p>

        <p>509.5f If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics blocks, it will trigger only if
          the creature has those characteristics at the point blockers are declared, or at the point an effect causes it
          to block. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger
          only if the creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked creature. If an ability
          triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if
          the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those
          abilities will trigger if the relevant creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger
          condition later on.</p>
        <p>Example: A creature has the ability “Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a white creature, destroy that
          creature at end of combat.” If the creature becomes blocked by a black creature that is later turned white,
          the ability will not trigger.</p>

        <p>509.5g An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers if no
          creatures are declared as blockers for that creature. It will trigger even if the creature was never declared
          as an attacker (for example, if it entered the battlefield attacking). It won’t trigger if the attacking
          creature is blocked and then all its blockers are removed from combat.</p>

        <p>509.6. If a spell or ability causes a creature on the battlefield to block an attacking creature, the active
          player announces the blocking creature’s placement in the attacking creature’s damage assignment order. The
          relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. Then the defending player announces the
          attacking creature’s placement in the blocking creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among
          the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged. This is done as part of the blocking effect.</p>

        <p>509.7. If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature
          it’s blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what
          it’s blocking), then the active player announces the new creature’s placement in the blocked creature’s damage
          assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. A creature put onto
          the battlefield this way is “blocking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never
          “blocked.”</p>
        <p>Example: Giant Spider is blocked by Canyon Minotaur. The defending player casts Flash Foliage, which creates
          a Saproling creature token blocking the Giant Spider. Giant Spider’s controller announces the Giant Spider’s
          damage assignment order as the Saproling token, then Canyon Minotaur.</p>

        <p>509.7a If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield blocking specifies it’s blocking a certain
          creature and that creature is no longer attacking, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never
          considered a blocking creature. The same is true if the controller of the creature that’s put onto the
          battlefield blocking isn’t a defending player for the specified attacking creature.</p>

        <p>509.7b A creature that’s put onto the battlefield blocking isn’t affected by requirements or restrictions
          that apply to the declaration of blockers.</p>

        <h2 id="510">
          510. Combat Damage Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>510.1. First, the active player announces how each attacking creature assigns its combat damage, then the
          defending player announces how each blocking creature assigns its combat damage. This turn-based action
          doesn’t use the stack. A player assigns a creature’s combat damage according to the following rules:</p>

        <p>510.1a Each attacking creature and each blocking creature assigns combat damage equal to its power. Creatures
          that would assign 0 or less damage this way don’t assign combat damage at all.</p>

        <p>510.1b An unblocked creature assigns its combat damage to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking. If it
          isn’t currently attacking anything (if, for example, it was attacking a planeswalker that has left the
          battlefield), it assigns no combat damage.</p>

        <p>510.1c A blocked creature assigns its combat damage to the creatures blocking it. If no creatures are
          currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat
          damage. If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or
          more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage
          assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocked creature to divide its combat damage. However,
          it can’t assign combat damage to a creature that’s blocking it unless, when combat damage assignments are
          complete, each creature that precedes that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage. When
          checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from
          other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects
          that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. An amount of damage that’s greater than a
          creature’s lethal damage may be assigned to it.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a
          0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2
          damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1 damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a
          0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player
          casts Giant Growth targeting Pride Guardian, which gives it +3/+3 until end of turn. Vastwood Gorger must
          assign its 5 damage to the Guardian.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a
          0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player
          casts Mending Hands targeting Pride Guardian, which prevents the next 4 damage that would be dealt to it.
          Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2 damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1
          damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Enormous Baloth (a 7/7 creature) is Trained Armodon (a
          3/3 creature) that already has 2 damage marked on it, then Foriysian Brigade (a 2/4 creature that can block an
          additional creature), then Silverback Ape (a 5/5 creature). The damage assignment order of an attacking
          Durkwood Boars (a 4/4 creature) is the same Foriysian Brigade, then Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature). Among other
          possibilities, the active player may have the Baloth assign 1 damage to the Armodon, 1 damage to the Brigade,
          and 5 damage to the Ape, and have the Boars assign 3 damage to the Brigade and 1 damage to the Piker.</p>

        <p>510.1d A blocking creature assigns combat damage to the creatures it’s blocking. If it isn’t currently
          blocking any creatures (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat
          damage. If it’s blocking exactly one creature, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If it’s
          blocking two or more creatures, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage
          assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocking creature to divide its combat damage. However,
          it can’t assign combat damage to a creature that it’s blocking unless, when combat damage assignments are
          complete, each creature that precedes that blocked creature is assigned lethal damage. When checking for
          assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other
          creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that
          might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. An amount of damage that’s greater than a creature’s
          lethal damage may be assigned to it.</p>

        <p>510.1e Once a player has assigned combat damage from each attacking or blocking creature they control, the
          total damage assignment (not solely the damage assignment of any individual attacking or blocking creature) is
          checked to see if it complies with the above rules. If it doesn’t, the combat damage assignment is illegal;
          the game returns to the moment before that player began to assign combat damage. (See rule 723, “Handling
          Illegal Actions.”)</p>

        <p>510.2. Second, all combat damage that’s been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t
          use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is
          assigned and the time it’s dealt.</p>
        <p>Example: Squadron Hawk (a 1/1 creature with flying) and Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature) are attacking. Mogg
          Fanatic (a 1/1 creature with the ability “Sacrifice Mogg Fanatic: Mogg Fanatic deals 1 damage to any target.”)
          blocks the Goblin Piker. The defending player sacrifices Mogg Fanatic during the declare blockers step to deal
          1 damage to the Squadron Hawk. The Hawk is destroyed. The Piker deals and is dealt no combat damage this turn.
          If the defending player instead left Mogg Fanatic on the battlefield, the Fanatic and the Piker would have
          dealt lethal damage to one another, but the Squadron Hawk couldn’t have been dealt damage.</p>

        <p>510.3. Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>510.3a Any abilities that triggered on damage being dealt or while state-based actions are performed
          afterward are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered
          doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</p>

        <p>510.4. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see
          rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are
          those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step,
          the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the
          remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage
          step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that
          step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.</p>

        <h2 id="511">
          511. End of Combat Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>511.1. The end of combat step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority.
          (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>511.2. Abilities that trigger “at end of combat” trigger as the end of combat step begins. Effects that last
          “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase.</p>

        <p>511.3. As soon as the end of combat step ends, all creatures and planeswalkers are removed from combat. After
          the end of combat step ends, the combat phase is over and the postcombat main phase begins (see rule 505).</p>

        <h2 id="512">
          512. Ending Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>512.1. The ending phase consists of two steps: end and cleanup.</p>

        <h2 id="513">
          513. End Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>513.1. The end step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule
          117, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>

        <p>513.1a Previously, abilities that triggered at the beginning of the end step were printed with the trigger
          condition “at end of turn.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card
          reference to say “at the beginning of the end step” or “at the beginning of the next end step.”</p>

        <p>513.2. If a permanent with an ability that triggers “at the beginning of the end step” enters the battlefield
          during this step, that ability won’t trigger until the next turn’s end step. Likewise, if a delayed triggered
          ability that triggers “at the beginning of the next end step” is created during this step, that ability won’t
          trigger until the next turn’s end step. In other words, the step doesn’t “back up” so those abilities can go
          on the stack. This rule applies only to triggered abilities; it doesn’t apply to continuous effects whose
          durations say “until end of turn” or “this turn.” (See rule 514, “Cleanup Step.”)</p>

        <h2 id="514">
          514. Cleanup Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>514.1. First, if the active player’s hand contains more cards than their maximum hand size (normally seven),
          they discard enough cards to reduce their hand size to that number. This turn-based action doesn’t use the
          stack.</p>

        <p>514.2. Second, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage marked on permanents (including
          phased-out permanents) is removed and all “until end of turn” and “this turn” effects end. This turn-based
          action doesn’t use the stack.</p>

        <p>514.3. Normally, no player receives priority during the cleanup step, so no spells can be cast and no
          abilities can be activated. However, this rule is subject to the following exception:</p>

        <p>514.3a At this point, the game checks to see if any state-based actions would be performed and/or any
          triggered abilities are waiting to be put onto the stack (including those that trigger “at the beginning of
          the next cleanup step”). If so, those state-based actions are performed, then those triggered abilities are
          put on the stack, then the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities. Once
          the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, another cleanup step begins.</p>

          601. Casting Spells
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>601.1. Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as
          “playing” that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle
          card reference so they now refer to “casting” that spell or that card.</p>

        <p>601.1a Some effects still refer to “playing” a card. “Playing a card” means playing that card as a land or
          casting that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.</p>

        <p>601.2. To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its
          costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell
          (rules 601.2a–d) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2f–h). To cast a spell, a player follows
          the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process
          (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while
          performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal ; the game returns to the moment before the casting
          of that spell was proposed (see rule 723, “Handling Illegal Actions”).</p>

        <p>601.2a To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where
          it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or
          the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. The spell remains on the stack
          until it’s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>601.2b If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the player wishes to
          splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.46), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has
          alternative or additional costs that will be paid as it’s being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see
          rules 118.8 and 118.9), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule
          601.2f). A player can’t apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell.
          If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as it’s being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see
          rule 107.3), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the
          text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell,
          that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the
          spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they
          intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the
          player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or the corresponding colored mana cost for each of those
          symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing
          to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player’s options when making these choices.</p>

        <p>601.2c The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell
          requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost)
          or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those
          targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was
          chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will
          choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell’s
          text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesn’t change, even if the
          information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for
          any one instance of the word “target” on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word “target” in multiple
          places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it
          fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the
          player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any
          rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or
          players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players
          become the target of a spell trigger at this point; they’ll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has
          finished being cast.)</p>
        <p>Example: If a spell says “Tap two target creatures,” then the same creature can’t be chosen twice; the spell
          requires two different legal targets. A spell that says “Destroy target artifact and target land,” however,
          can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word “target” in multiple places.</p>

        <p>601.2d If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among
          one or more targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of
          whatever is being divided.</p>

        <p>601.2e The game checks to see if the proposed spell can legally be cast. If the proposed spell is illegal,
          the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 723, “Handling Illegal
          Actions”).</p>

        <p>601.2f The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells
          have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide
          other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding
          cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all
          additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the
          player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost
          reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can’t be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is
          determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes
          “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.</p>

        <p>601.2g If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities
          (see rule 605, “Mana Abilities”). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.</p>

        <p>601.2h The player pays the total cost in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can’t
          be paid.</p>
        <p>Example: You cast Altar’s Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You
          sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spell’s
          total cost is “locked in” before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though you’re
          sacrificing the Familiar.</p>

        <p>601.2i Once the steps described in 601.2a–h are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the
          spell as it’s cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast
          or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spell’s controller had priority before casting it, they get
          priority.</p>

        <p>601.3. A player can begin to cast a spell only if a rule or effect allows that player to cast it and no rule
          or effect prohibits that player from casting it.</p>

        <p>601.3a If an effect prohibits a player from casting a spell with certain qualities, that player may consider
          any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause those qualities to change. If any such
          choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may
          begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Void Winnower, which reads, in part, “Your opponents can't cast spells with even
          converted mana costs.” That player’s opponent may begin to cast Rolling Thunder, a card whose mana cost is
          {X}{R}{R}, because the chosen value of X may cause the spell’s converted mana cost to become odd.</p>

        <p>601.3b If an effect allows a player to cast a spell with certain qualities as though it had flash, that
          player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause that spell’s qualities
          to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as
          though it had flash.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect says that you may cast Aura spells as though they had flash, and you have a creature card
          with bestow in your hand. Because choosing the bestow ability’s alternative cost causes that spell to become
          an Aura spell, you may legally begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.</p>

        <p>601.3c If an effect allows a player to cast a spell as though it had flash only if an alternative or
          additional cost is paid, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.</p>

        <p>601.3d If a spell would have flash only if certain conditions are met, its controller may begin to cast that
          spell as though it had flash if those conditions are met.</p>

        <p>601.3e Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics
          are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics
          replace the object’s characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that
          object once it has those characteristics are also considered.</p>
        <p>Example: Garruk’s Horde says, in part, “You may cast creature spells from the top of your library.” If you
          control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is a noncreature card with morph, you may cast it
          using its morph ability.</p>
        <p>Example: Melek, Izzet Paragon says, in part, “You may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your
          library.” If you control Melek, Izzet Paragon and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, an adventurer
          creature card whose Adventure is an instant named Chop Down, you may cast Chop Down but not Giant Killer. If
          instead you control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, you may cast Giant Killer
          but not Chop Down.</p>

        <p>601.4. If a player is no longer allowed to cast a spell after completing its proposal (see rules 601.2a–d),
          the casting of the spell is illegal and the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was
          proposed (see rule 723, “Handling Illegal Actions”). It doesn’t matter if a rule or effect would make the
          casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spell’s costs (see rules 601.2f-h) or any time
          after the spell has been cast.</p>

        <p>601.5. Some spells specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would
          normally do while it’s being cast, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does
          so when the spell’s controller normally would do so.</p>

        <p>601.5a If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the spell’s controller decides which
          of those opponents will make the choice.</p>

        <p>601.5b If the spell instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the spell
          is being cast, the spell’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.
        </p>

        <p>601.6. Casting a spell that alters costs won’t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.</p>

          602. Activating Activated Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>602.1. Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation
          instructions (if any).]”</p>

        <p>602.1a The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability’s activation cost must be paid by
          the player who is activating it.</p>
        <p>Example: The activation cost of an ability that reads “{2}, {T}: You gain 1 life” is two mana of any type
          plus tapping the permanent that has the ability.</p>

        <p>602.1b Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while
          activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a
          player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of
          the ability’s effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they
          appear last, after the ability’s effect.</p>

        <p>602.1c An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to
          activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.</p>

        <p>602.1d Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that
          ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now
          refer to “activating” that ability.</p>

        <p>602.2. To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually
          resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can
          activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows
          the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to
          comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability
          started to be activated (see rule 723, “Handling Illegal Actions”). Announcements and payments can’t be
          altered after they’ve been made.</p>

        <p>602.2a The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated
          from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed. That ability is created on the stack as an
          object that’s not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that
          created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability
          remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>602.2b The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell
          listed in rules 601.2b–i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An
          activated ability’s analog to a spell’s mana cost (as referenced in rule 601.2f) is its activation cost.</p>

        <p>602.3. Some abilities specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would
          normally do while it’s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent
          does so when the ability’s controller normally would do so.</p>

        <p>602.3a If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the ability’s controller decides
          which of those opponents will make the choice.</p>

        <p>602.3b If the ability instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the
          ability is being activated, the ability’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception
          to rule 101.4.</p>

        <p>602.4. Activating an ability that alters costs won’t affect spells and abilities that are already on the
          stack.</p>

        <p>602.5. A player can’t begin to activate an ability that’s prohibited from being activated.</p>

        <p>602.5a A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol ({T}) or the untap symbol ({Q}) in its activation
          cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control since the start of their
          most recent turn. Ignore this rule for creatures with haste (see rule 702.10).</p>

        <p>602.5b If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, “Activate this ability only once
          each turn”), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.</p>

        <p>602.5c If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on its use from another object, that
          restriction applies only to that ability as acquired from that object. It doesn’t apply to other, identically
          worded abilities.</p>

        <p>602.5d Activated abilities that read “Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery” mean the
          player must follow the timing rules for casting a sorcery spell, though the ability isn’t actually a sorcery.
          The player doesn’t actually need to have a sorcery card that they could cast.</p>

        <p>602.5e Activated abilities that read “Activate this ability only any time you could cast an instant” mean the
          player must follow the timing rules for casting an instant spell, though the ability isn’t actually an
          instant. The player doesn’t actually need to have an instant card that they could cast.</p>

        <h2 id="603">
          603. Handling Triggered Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>603.1. Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[When/Whenever/At]
          [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]”</p>

        <p>603.1a A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target
          or state that it can’t be countered. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions while the
          ability is on the stack.</p>

        <p>603.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability’s trigger event, that ability
          automatically triggers. The ability doesn’t do anything at this point.</p>

        <p>603.2a Because they aren’t cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn’t legal to
          cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated don’t affect them.
        </p>

        <p>603.2b When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step
          trigger.</p>

        <p>603.2c An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly
          if one event contains multiple occurrences.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition reads, “Whenever a land is put into a graveyard
          from the battlefield, . . . .” If someone casts a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will trigger once
          for each land put into the graveyard during the spell’s resolution.</p>

        <p>603.2d An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than
          simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that
          ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesn’t
          invoke itself repeatedly and doesn’t apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers.
        </p>

        <p>603.2e Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes attached” or “becomes blocked”).
          These trigger only at the time the named event happens—they don’t trigger if that state already exists or
          retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” or “becomes untapped”
          doesn’t trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” triggers only when the status of a
          permanent that’s already on the battlefield changes from untapped to tapped.</p>

        <p>603.2f If a triggered ability’s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no
          time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.</p>

        <p>603.2g An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced
          won’t trigger anything.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that triggers on damage being dealt won’t trigger if all the damage is prevented.</p>

        <p>603.3. Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object that’s not a card the
          next time a player would receive priority. See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.” The ability becomes the
          topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It
          remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an
          effect moves it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>603.3a A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered,
          unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules
          603.7d–f.</p>

        <p>603.3b If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, each player, in
          APNAP order, puts triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule 101.4.)
          Then the game once again checks for and resolves state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities
          that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are
          performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.</p>

        <p>603.3c If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on
          the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example),
          that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 700.2.)</p>

        <p>603.3d The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process
          for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2c–d. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the
          stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability
          illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.</p>

        <p>603.4. A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].” When the
          trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it
          is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves.
          If the condition isn’t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that
          this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. (The
          word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to
          an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.)</p>
        <p>Example: Felidar Sovereign reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 40 or more life, you win the
          game.” Its controller’s life total is checked as that player’s upkeep begins. If that player has 39 or less
          life, the ability doesn’t trigger at all. If that player has 40 or more life, the ability triggers and goes on
          the stack. As the ability resolves, that player’s life total is checked again. If that player has 39 or less
          life at this time, the ability is removed from the stack and has no effect. If that player has 40 or more life
          at this time, the ability resolves and that player wins the game.</p>

        <p>603.5. Some triggered abilities’ effects are optional (they contain “may,” as in “At the beginning of your
          upkeep, you may draw a card”). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their
          controller intends to exercise the ability’s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves.
          Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect “unless” something is true or a player chooses to do
          something will go on the stack normally; the “unless” part of the ability is dealt with when the ability
          resolves.</p>

        <p>603.6. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities
          with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution,
          these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the
          zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything.
          The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it
          left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a
          library or an opponent’s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before
          the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and
          leaves-the-battlefield triggers.</p>

        <p>603.6a Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written,
          “When [this object] enters the battlefield, . . . “ or “Whenever a [type] enters the battlefield, . . .” Each
          time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including
          the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.</p>

        <p>603.6b Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the
          battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified
          characteristics. Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule
          603.6d).</p>
        <p>Example: If an effect reads “All lands are creatures” and a land card is played, the effect makes the land
          card into a creature the moment it enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a
          creature enters the battlefield. Conversely, if an effect reads “All creatures lose all abilities” and a
          creature card with an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability enters the battlefield, that effect will cause
          it to lose its abilities the moment it enters the battlefield, so the enters-the-battlefield ability won’t
          trigger.</p>

        <p>603.6c Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone,
          or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but
          aren’t limited to, “When [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .” or “Whenever [something] is put into a
          graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” (See also rule 603.10.) An ability that attempts to do something to
          the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that
          triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield
          ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.</p>

        <p>603.6d Some permanents have text that reads “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this
          permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . ,” or “[This
          permanent] enters the battlefield tapped.” Such text is a static ability—not a triggered ability—whose effect
          occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.</p>

        <p>603.6e Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield.
          These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can
          also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner’s graveyard after state-based actions have been
          checked. See rule 400.7.</p>

        <p>603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed
          triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin the
          ability.</p>

        <p>603.7a Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of
          a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action.
          A delayed triggered ability won’t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event
          occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.</p>
        <p>Example: Part of an effect reads “When this creature leaves the battlefield,” but the creature in question
          leaves the battlefield before the spell or ability creating the effect resolves. In this case, the delayed
          ability never triggers.</p>
        <p>Example: If an effect reads “When this creature becomes untapped” and the named creature becomes untapped
          before the effect resolves, the ability waits for the next time that creature untaps.</p>

        <p>603.7b A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once—the next time its trigger event occurs—unless it
          has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the
          ability doesn’t have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event
          causes the ability to trigger.</p>

        <p>603.7c A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object
          changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time
          the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won’t affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone
          and then returned, it’s a new object and thus won’t be affected. See rule 400.7.)</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that reads “Exile this creature at the beginning of the next end step” will exile the
          permanent even if it’s no longer a creature during the next end step. However, it won’t do anything if the
          permanent left the battlefield before then.</p>

        <p>603.7d If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that
          spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it
          resolved.</p>

        <p>603.7e If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed
          triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered
          ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.</p>

        <p>603.7f If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be
          created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller
          of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement
          effect was applied.</p>

        <p>603.7g If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that
          player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The
          controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the
          action was taken.</p>

        <p>603.8. Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a
          particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as
          the game state matches the condition. They’ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are
          called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered
          ability doesn’t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the
          stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its
          trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent’s ability reads, “Whenever you have no cards in hand, draw a card.” If its controller
          plays the last card from their hand, the ability will trigger once and won’t trigger again until it has left
          the stack. If its controller casts a spell that reads “Discard your hand, then draw that many cards,” the
          ability will trigger during the spell’s resolution because the player’s hand was momentarily empty.</p>

        <p>603.9. Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger
          when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the
          result of a draw. See rule 104.3.</p>

        <p>603.10. Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any
          trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger
          conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are
          exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those abilities trigger, using the
          existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of
          exceptions is as follows:</p>

        <p>603.10a Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities
          that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can
          see is put into a hand or library.</p>
        <p>Example: Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that has the ability “Whenever a
          creature dies, you gain 1 life.” Someone casts a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and
          enchantments. The artifact’s ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner’s graveyard at
          the same time as the creatures.</p>

        <p>603.10b Abilities that trigger when a permanent phases out look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10c Abilities that trigger specifically when an object becomes unattached look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10d Abilities that trigger when a player loses control of an object look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10e Abilities that trigger when a spell is countered look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10f Abilities that trigger when a player loses the game look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10g Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks away from a plane look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.11. Some objects have a static ability that’s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule 607,
          “Linked Abilities.”) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first,
          followed by each triggered ability that’s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are
          written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that reads “Reveal the first card you draw each turn. Whenever you reveal a basic land
          card this way, draw a card” is a static ability linked to a triggered ability.</p>

        <p>603.12. A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered
          ability that triggers “when [a player] [does or doesn’t]” take that action or “when [something happens] this
          way.” These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7),
          except that they’re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or
          events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.</p>
        <p>Example: Heart-Piercer Manticore has an ability that reads “When Heart-Piercer Manticore enters the
          battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, Heart-Piercer Manticore deals damage equal to
          that creature’s power to any target.” The reflexive triggered ability triggers only when you sacrifice another
          creature due to the original triggered ability, and not if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.</p>

          604. Handling Static Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>604.1. Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written
          as statements, and they’re simply true.</p>

        <p>604.2. Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement
          effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has
          the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule
          113.6.</p>

        <p>604.3. Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys
          information about an object’s characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as
          in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override
          information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also
          function outside the game.</p>

        <p>604.3a A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets the following criteria: (1) It
          defines an object’s colors, subtypes, power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was
          granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it
          affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the
          characteristics of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to itself; and (5) it
          does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met.</p>

        <p>604.4. Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object they’re
          attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to
          a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.</p>

        <p>604.5. Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to
          countering the spell. Also, abilities that say “As an additional cost to cast . . . ,” “You may pay [cost]
          rather than pay [this object]’s mana cost,” and “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost” work
          while a spell is on the stack.</p>

        <p>604.6. Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually
          your hand). These are limited to those that read, “You may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” “You can’t
          [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” and “[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .”</p>

        <p>604.7. Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities can’t use an object’s last known
          information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.</p>

        <h2 id="605">
          605. Mana Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>605.1. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special
          rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of
          what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as “Activate this ability only any time
          you could cast an instant”) they may have.</p>

        <p>605.1a An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a
          target (see rule 115.6), it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves, and it’s not a loyalty
          ability. (See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”)</p>

        <p>605.1b A triggered ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a
          target (see rule 115.6), it triggers from the resolution of an activated mana ability (see rule 605.1a) or
          from mana being added to a player’s mana pool, and it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves.
        </p>

        <p>605.2. A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn’t allow it to produce mana.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent has an ability that reads “{T}: Add {G} for each creature you control.” The ability is
          still a mana ability even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.</p>

        <p>605.3. Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see
          rule 602.2), with the following exceptions:</p>

        <p>605.3a A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting
          a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana
          payment, even if it’s in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability.</p>

        <p>605.3b An activated mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise
          responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after it is activated. (See rule 405.6c.)</p>

        <p>605.3c Once a player begins to activate a mana ability, that ability can’t be activated again until it has
          resolved.</p>

        <p>605.4. Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule 603, “Handling
          Triggered Abilities”), with the following exception:</p>

        <p>605.4a A triggered mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise
          responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for
          priority.</p>
        <p>Example: An enchantment reads, “Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type
          that land produced.” If a player taps lands for mana while casting a spell, the additional mana is added
          immediately and can be used to pay for the spell.</p>

        <p>605.5. Abilities that don’t meet the criteria specified in rules 605.1a–b and spells aren’t mana abilities.
        </p>

        <p>605.5a An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool
          when it resolves. The same is true for a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event
          other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers from activating a mana ability but
          couldn’t produce mana. These follow the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.</p>

        <p>605.5b A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it
          resolves. It’s cast and resolves just like any other spell. Some older cards were printed with the card type
          “mana source”; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and are now instants.</p>

        <h2 id="606">
          606. Loyalty Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>606.1. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to special rules.</p>

        <p>606.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Normally, only
          planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.</p>

        <p>606.3. A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and
          the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty
          ability of that permanent that turn.</p>

        <p>606.4. The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a
          certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the ability’s cost.</p>

        <p>606.5. A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost can’t be activated unless the permanent has at least
          that many loyalty counters on it.</p>

        <h2 id="607">
          607. Linked Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>607.1. An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or
          objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If
          so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players
          that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.</p>

        <p>607.1a An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants that ability to that object is
          considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes.</p>

        <p>607.1b An ability printed on either face of a transforming double-faced card (see rule 711) is considered to
          be “printed on” that object for these purposes, regardless of which face is up.</p>

        <p>607.1c An ability printed on an object that fulfills both criteria described in rule 607.1 is linked to
          itself.</p>

        <p>607.2. There are different kinds of linked abilities.</p>

        <p>607.2a If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that instructs a player to exile one
          or more cards and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with
          [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that
          were put there as a result of an instruction to exile them in the first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2b If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more
          cards to be exiled and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled
          with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone
          that were put there as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability. See rule 614,
          “Replacement Effects.”</p>

        <p>607.2c If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that puts one or more objects onto
          the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to objects “put onto the battlefield with [this
          object]” or “created with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to objects put
          onto the battlefield as a result of the first.</p>

        <p>607.2d If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to “choose a [value]” and an ability
          printed on it that refers to “the chosen [value],” “the last chosen [value],” or similar, those abilities are
          linked. The second ability refers only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2e If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to choose from between two or more
          words that otherwise have no rules meaning and an ability printed on it that refers to a choice involving one
          or more of those words, those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to a choice made as a result of
          the first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2f If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a cost as it enters the
          battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] entered the
          battlefield,” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a cost paid as a result of the
          first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2g If an object has both a static ability and one or more triggered abilities printed on it in the same
          paragraph, each of those triggered abilities is linked to the static ability. Each triggered ability refers
          only to actions taken as a result of the static ability. See rule 603.11.</p>

        <p>607.2h If an object has a kicker ability printed on it and an ability printed on it that refers to whether
          that object was kicked, those abilities are linked. The second refers only to whether the intent to pay the
          kicker cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as a spell. If a kicker ability lists
          multiple costs, it will have multiple abilities linked to it. Each of those abilities will specify which
          kicker cost it refers to. See rule 702.32, “Kicker.”</p>

        <p>607.2i If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a variable additional cost as
          it’s cast and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] was cast,” these
          abilities are linked. The second refers only to the value chosen for the cost listed in the first as the
          object was cast as a spell. See rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>607.2j The two abilities represented by the champion keyword are linked abilities. See rule 702.71,
          “Champion.”</p>

        <p>607.2k Abilities preceded by an anchor word are linked to the ability that allows a player to choose that
          anchor word. See rule 614.12b.</p>

        <p>607.2m If an object has a static ability printed on it that allows a player to exile one or more cards
          “before you shuffle your deck to start the game” and an ability printed on it that refers to cards “exiled
          with cards named [this object’s name],” the second ability is linked to the first ability of any objects that
          had the specified name before the game began.</p>

        <p>607.3. If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as “the exiled card,” “a
          card exiled with [this card],” or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually
          because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any
          information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or converted mana cost, it gets multiple answers.
          If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that
          ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability
          performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.</p>

        <p>607.4. An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.</p>
        <p>Example: Paradise Plume has the following three abilities: “As Paradise Plume enters the battlefield, choose
          a color,” “Whenever a player casts a spell of the chosen color, you may gain 1 life,” and “{T}: Add one mana
          of the chosen color.” The first and second abilities are linked. The first and third abilities are linked.</p>

        <p>607.5. If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be
          similarly linked to one another on that object even though they weren’t printed on that object. They can’t be
          linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had
          in the past.</p>
        <p>Example: Arc-Slogger has the ability “{R}, Exile the top ten cards of your library: Arc-Slogger deals 2
          damage to any target.” Sisters of Stone Death has the ability “{B}{G}: Exile target creature blocking or
          blocked by Sisters of Stone Death” and the ability “{2}{B}: Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone
          Death onto the battlefield under your control.” Quicksilver Elemental has the ability “{U}: Quicksilver
          Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.” If a player has Quicksilver
          Elemental gain Arc-Slogger’s ability, activates it, then has Quicksilver Elemental gain Sisters of Stone
          Death’s abilities, activates the exile ability, and then activates the return-to-the-battlefield ability, only
          the creature card Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Sisters of Stone Death’s ability can be returned to the
          battlefield. Creature cards Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Arc-Slogger’s ability can’t be returned.</p>

        <p>607.5a If an object gains an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesn’t copy that ability’s
          linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered
          to be “undefined.” If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability won’t do anything.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Voice of All enters the battlefield and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in
          part, “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” and “Voice of All has protection from the
          chosen color.” Unstable Shapeshifter never had a chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didn’t
          enter the battlefield as Voice of All so it doesn’t gain a protection ability.</p>
        <p>Example: A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Voice of All, and the Doppelganger’s
          controller chooses blue. Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves, which has the ability, “{T}: Add one
          mana of the chosen color.” Even though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasn’t chosen for the
          ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves. If that mana ability of the Doppelganger is
          activated, it will not produce mana.</p>

          608. Resolving Spells and Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>608.1. Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves. (See rule
          609, “Effects.”)</p>

        <p>608.2. If the object that’s resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may
          involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described
          in rules 608.2c–j are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The step described in rule 608.2k is
          followed last.</p>

        <p>608.2a If a triggered ability has an intervening “if” clause, it checks whether the clause’s condition is
          true. If it isn’t, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve.
          See rule 603.4.</p>

        <p>608.2b If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target
          that’s no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may
          cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have
          changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known
          information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word “target,” are now
          illegal, the spell or ability doesn’t resolve. It’s removed from the stack and, if it’s a spell, put into its
          owner’s graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, won’t be
          affected by parts of a resolving spell’s effect for which they’re illegal. Other parts of the effect for which
          those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects
          that affect game rules (see rule 613.11), those effects don’t apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect
          requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the
          effect that requires that information won’t happen.</p>
        <p>Example: Sorin’s Thirst is a black instant that reads, “Sorin’s Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and
          you gain 2 life.” If the creature isn’t a legal target during the resolution of Sorin’s Thirst (say, if the
          creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorin’s Thirst doesn’t resolve. Its
          controller doesn’t gain any life.</p>
        <p>Example: Plague Spores reads, “Destroy target nonblack creature and target land. They can’t be regenerated.”
          Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the
          creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the
          black creature land is still a legal target for the “target land” part of the spell. The “destroy target
          nonblack creature” part of the spell won’t affect that permanent, but the “destroy target land” part of the
          spell will still destroy it. It can’t be regenerated.</p>

        <p>608.2c The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However,
          replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of
          earlier text (for example, “Destroy target creature. It can’t be regenerated” or “Counter target spell. If
          that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s
          graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and
          apply the rules of English to the text.</p>

        <p>608.2d If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of
          casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player
          announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible,
          with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action
          (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player
          chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such
          that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect
          divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target
          objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack
          rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.)</p>
        <p>Example: A spell’s instruction reads, “You may sacrifice a creature. If you don’t, you lose 4 life.” A player
          who controls no creatures can’t choose the sacrifice option.</p>

        <p>608.2e Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses,
          that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and
          then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP
          order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4.</p>

        <p>608.2f If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking
          that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do
          so by following the steps in rules 601.2a–i, except no player receives priority after it’s cast. That spell
          becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve,
          which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities
          can normally be activated during resolution.</p>

        <p>608.2g If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield),
          the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a
          specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that
          object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect
          has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. See
          rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most
          recently existed—that does it, not the ability.</p>

        <p>608.2h If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified
          characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that reads “Destroy all black creatures” destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that
          reads “Destroy all nonblack creatures” doesn’t.</p>

        <p>608.2i If an ability’s effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by
          that ability’s cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed
          characteristics.</p>
        <p>Example: Wall of Tears says “Whenever Wall of Tears blocks a creature, return that creature to its owner’s
          hand at end of combat.” If Wall of Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before
          the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to its owner’s hand.</p>

        <p>608.2j If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it
          starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully.</p>

        <p>608.2k As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell’s resolution, the spell is put into its owner’s
          graveyard. As the final part of an ability’s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to
          exist.</p>

        <p>608.3. If the object that’s resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution involves a single step (unless
          it’s an Aura or a mutating creature spell). The spell card becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield
          under the control of the spell’s controller.</p>

        <p>608.3a If the object that’s resolving is an Aura spell, its resolution involves two steps. First, it checks
          whether the target specified by its enchant ability is still legal, as described in rule 608.2b. (See rule
          702.5, “Enchant.”) If so, the spell card becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control
          of the spell’s controller attached to the object it was targeting.</p>

        <p>608.3b If the object that’s resolving is a copy of a permanent spell, that object becomes a token permanent
          and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller. It is no longer a copy of a
          spell. The token put onto the battlefield this way is not “created” for the purposes of any replacement
          effects or triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.</p>

        <p>608.3c If the object that’s resolving is a mutating creature spell, its resolution involves two steps. First,
          it checks whether the target creature with the same owner as the spell is still legal. If so, the spell card
          merges with that permanent. Otherwise, it becomes a creature spell and is put onto the battlefield under the
          control of the spell’s controller. (See rule 702.139, “Mutate.”)</p>

        <p>608.3d If a permanent spell resolves but its controller can’t put it onto the battlefield, that player puts
          it into its owner’s graveyard.</p>
        <p>Example: Worms of the Earth has the ability “Lands can’t enter the battlefield.” Clone says “You may have
          Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.” If a player casts Clone and chooses
          to copy Dryad Arbor (a land creature) while Worms of the Earth is on the battlefield, Clone can’t enter the
          battlefield from the stack. It’s put into its owner’s graveyard.</p>

          800. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>800.1. A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional
          optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.</p>

        <p>800.2. These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of
          variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.</p>

        <p>800.3. Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck
          construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be
          found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.</p>

        <p>800.4. Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.
        </p>

        <p>800.4a When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and any
          effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any
          objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects
          still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as
          soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left,
          priority passes to the next player in turn order who’s still in the game.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, “You control enchanted creature,” on Bianca’s Assault
          Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Bianca’s control. If,
          instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alex’s graveyard.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, “Gain control of target creature until end of
          turn,” targeting Bianca’s Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treason’s change-of-control effect
          ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Bianca’s control.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, “Search target opponent’s library for a creature card and put that
          card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,” targeting Bianca. Alex
          puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Bianca’s library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also
          leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, “Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if
          Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creature’s controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.”
          If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alex’s control leave the game,
          and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other player’s control remain in the game.</p>

        <p>800.4b If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesn’t. If a token
          would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would
          be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object
          remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they aren’t.
        </p>

        <p>800.4c If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect
          giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by
          default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the
          control-changing effect ends.</p>

        <p>800.4d If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it
          isn’t created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put
          onto the stack, it isn’t put on the stack.</p>
        <p>Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, “Whenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target
          creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of the
          next end step.” During Alex’s turn, Bianca uses Astral Slide’s ability to exile Alex’s Hypnotic Specter.
          Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered
          ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isn’t
          put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield.</p>

        <p>800.4e If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isn’t assigned.</p>

        <p>800.4f If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the controller of the object
          chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the
          controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.</p>

        <p>800.4g If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order
          makes that choice.</p>

        <p>800.4h If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information
          about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about
          that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players
          have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game.</p>

        <p>800.4i If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active
          player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority,
          or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.</p>

        <p>800.4j If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesn’t begin.</p>

        <p>800.4k When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player’s
          next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither
          expire immediately nor last indefinitely.</p>

        <p>800.4m When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This
          is an exception to rule 800.4a. See rule 407, “Ante.”</p>

        <p>800.4n In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead
          the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar
          controller leaves the game. See rule 309.5.</p>

        <p>800.5. Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually
          agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice
          to determine seating order, and so on.</p>

        <p>800.6. In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that
          player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent
          mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>

        <p>800.7. In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesn’t skip the draw
          step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their
          first turn. See rule 103.7.</p>

        <h2 id="801">
          801. Limited Range of Influence Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>801.1. Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It’s always
          used in the Emperor variant (see rule 809), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.</p>

        <p>801.2. A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that
          the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of
          influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s
          range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making
          choices, and winning the game.</p>

        <p>801.2a The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may
          have different ranges of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within
          your range of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to
          your right are within your range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.2b A player is always within their own range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.2c The particular players within each player’s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.</p>
        <p>Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated
          to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alex’s range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter
          Alex’s range of influence at the start of the next turn.</p>

        <p>801.2d An object is within a player’s range of influence if it’s controlled by that player or by another
          player within that many seats of that player.</p>

        <p>801.3. Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller’s range of influence or planeswalkers
          controlled by those opponents. If no opponents are within a player’s range of influence, creatures that player
          controls can’t attack.</p>

        <p>801.4. Objects and players outside a player’s range of influence can’t be the targets of spells or abilities
          that player controls.</p>

        <p>801.5. Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of
          influence option is used.</p>

        <p>801.5a If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of
          influence.</p>
        <p>Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the
          ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, “{T}: Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to
          any target of an opponent’s choice,” targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other
          target. Rob must choose a target that’s in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the
          controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either
          himself or Alex.</p>

        <p>801.5b If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or
          players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the
          player’s range of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range
          of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, “An opponent chooses one —
          You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,” and chooses Carissa to make
          that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.</p>

        <p>801.5c If an effect requires a choice and there’s no player who can make that choice within its controller’s
          range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller’s left makes that choice.</p>
        <p>Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction,
          which reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put
          one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” Since no opponent is within the emperor’s range of
          influence, the nearest opponent to the emperor’s left separates the cards into piles.</p>

        <p>801.6. A player can’t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.7. A triggered ability doesn’t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of
          influence of its source’s controller.</p>
        <p>Example: In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob
          controls two Auras attached to Alex’s Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted
          creature becomes blocked,” and one with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by
          a creature.” Alex’s Runeclaw Bear attacks the player to Alex’s left and becomes blocked. The ability of Rob’s
          first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes blocked) happens within Rob’s range of
          influence. The ability of Rob’s second Aura doesn’t trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking
          creature, which is out of Rob’s range.</p>

        <p>801.7a If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player’s range of influence, use the
          game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger.
          See rules 603.6 and 603.10.</p>
        <p>Example: Carissa and Alex are outside each other’s range of influence. Carissa controls a Runeclaw Bear owned
          by Alex and they each control an Extractor Demon, a creature which reads, in part, “Whenever another creature
          leaves the battlefield, you may have target player mill two cards.” The Runeclaw Bear is destroyed and is put
          into Alex’s graveyard. The ability of Alex’s Extractor Demon doesn’t trigger because the
          leaves-the-battlefield event was outside Alex’s range of influence. The ability of Carissa’s Extractor Demon
          does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the
          leaves-the-battlefield event was within her range.</p>

        <p>801.8. An Aura can’t enchant an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Aura is
          attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action.
          See rule 704.</p>

        <p>801.9. An Equipment can’t equip an object outside its controller’s range of influence, and a Fortification
          can’t fortify an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is
          attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield.
          This is a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>801.10. Spells and abilities can’t affect objects or players outside their controller’s range of influence.
          The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of
          the effect will work normally.</p>
        <p>Example: In a six-player game in which each player has range of influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which
          reads, “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by
          Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. No other creatures are dealt damage.</p>

        <p>801.11. If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its
          controller’s range of influence. It doesn’t see objects or events outside its controller’s range of influence.
        </p>
        <p>Example: In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which
          reads, “Each creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature
          type with it.” Coat of Arms will boost Alex’s creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex,
          the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. It won’t take other creatures into account.</p>
        <p>Example: In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex. Coat of Arms will boost Rob’s creatures based
          on what creatures are controlled by players within Alex’s range of influence, including the player sitting to
          Alex’s left, who’s out of Rob’s range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.12. The “world rule” (see rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within
          its controller’s range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.13. Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or
          partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain
          instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions.
          See rule 614, “Replacement Effects,” and rule 615, “Prevention Effects.”</p>

        <p>801.13a If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its
          controller’s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Lava Axe (“Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker.”) targeting Rob. In
          response, Rob casts Captain’s Maneuver (“The next X damage that would be dealt to target creature,
          planeswalker, or player this turn is dealt to another target creature, planeswalker, or player instead.”) with
          X equal to 3, targeting Carissa. Carissa isn’t in Alex’s range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals
          2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.</p>

        <p>801.13b If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can
          affect only sources within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability
          creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only
          permanents and players within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability
          creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is
          specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or
          ability’s controller’s range of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Alex controls an enchantment that says,
          “Prevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures.” Carissa attacks Rob with a creature. The creature deals
          combat damage to Rob.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa casts Lightning Blast
          (“Lightning Blast deals 4 damage to any target.”) targeting Rob. In response, Alex casts Mending Hands
          (“Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”) targeting Rob. The damage to Rob is
          prevented.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa attacks Rob with a creature,
          and Rob blocks with a creature. Alex casts Fog (“Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.”)
          Carissa and Rob’s creatures deal combat damage to each other.</p>

        <p>801.14. If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that player’s opponents within that player’s
          range of influence lose the game instead.</p>

        <p>801.15. If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell
          or ability’s controller and all players within that player’s range of influence. They leave the game. All
          remaining players continue to play the game.</p>

        <p>801.16. If the game somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way
          to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as
          for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining
          players continue to play the game.</p>

        <p>801.17. Effects that restart the game (see rule 719) are exempt from the limited range of influence option.
          All players in the game will be involved in the new game.</p>

        <p>801.18. In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are
          exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect
          all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule 901, “Planechase.”</p>

        <h2 id="802">
          802. Attack Multiple Players Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>802.1. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is
          used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.</p>

        <p>802.2. As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn’t choose an opponent to become the defending
          player. Instead, all the attacking player’s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.</p>

        <p>802.2a Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending
          player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending
          player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless
          otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the
          controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the
          defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat
          or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a
          spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually
          determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be
          chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a creature with mountainwalk. Whether
          the creature with mountainwalk can be blocked depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.</p>

        <p>802.3. As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player or a
          planeswalker controlled by a defending player for it to attack. See rule 508, “Declare Attackers Step.”</p>

        <p>802.3a Restrictions and requirements that don’t apply to attacking a specific player are evaluated based on
          the entire group of attacking creatures. Restrictions and requirements that apply to attacking a specific
          player apply only to creatures attacking that player. The entire group of attacking creatures must still be
          legal. See rule 508.1.</p>

        <p>802.3b Creatures in a band can’t attack different players. See rule 702.21, “Banding.”</p>

        <p>802.4. If more than one player is being attacked or controls a planeswalker that’s being attacked, each
          defending player in APNAP order declares blockers as the declare blockers step begins. (See rule 101.4 and
          rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”) The first defending player declares all their blocks, then the second
          defending player, and so on.</p>

        <p>802.4a A defending player can block only with creatures they control. Those creatures can block only
          creatures attacking that player or a planeswalker that player controls.</p>

        <p>802.4b When determining whether a defending player’s blocks are legal, ignore any creatures attacking other
          players and any blocking creatures controlled by other players.</p>

        <p>802.5. After blockers have been declared, if any creatures are blocking multiple creatures, each defending
          player in APNAP order announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures for each blocking
          creature they control. See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”</p>

        <p>802.6. Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order. Other than that, the combat damage step proceeds just as in
          a two-player game. See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”</p>

        <h2 id="803">
          803. Attack Left and Attack Right Options
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>803.1. Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.</p>

        <p>803.1a If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their
          left. If a player’s nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.</p>

        <p>803.1b If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their
          right. If a player’s nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.</p>

        <h2 id="804">
          804. Deploy Creatures Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>804.1. The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that
          allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually don’t
          use this option.</p>

        <p>804.2. Each creature has the ability “{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate this
          ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.”</p>

        <h2 id="805">
          805. Shared Team Turns Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>805.1. Some multiplayer games between teams use the shared team turns option. It’s always used in the
          Two-Headed Giant variant (see rule 810) and the Archenemy casual variant (see rule 904). It can be used only
          if the members of each team are sitting in adjacent seats.</p>

        <p>805.2. Within each team, the player seated in the rightmost seat from that team’s perspective is the primary
          player. If the players on a team can’t agree on a choice, such as which creatures attack or what order
          triggered abilities are put on the stack, the primary player makes that choice.</p>

        <p>805.3. The methods described in rule 103.1 are used to determine which team will take the first turn. The
          team determined this way is the starting team.</p>

        <p>805.3a The process for handling mulligans is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in
          whatever order that team likes, declares whether that player will take a mulligan. Then the players on each
          other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans
          are taken at the same time. Teammates may consult while choosing which cards, if any, to put on the bottom of
          their library. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand. See
          rule 103.4.</p>

        <p>805.3b The process for handling cards that allow a player to begin the game with them on the battlefield is
          altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, may put any
          or all such cards onto the battlefield from that player’s opening hand. Teammates may consult while making
          their decisions. Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>805.4. Each team takes turns rather than each player.</p>

        <p>805.4a The team whose turn it is is the active team. Each other team is a nonactive team.</p>

        <p>805.4b Each player on a team draws a card during that team’s draw step.</p>

        <p>805.4c Each player on a team may play a land during each of that team’s turns.</p>

        <p>805.4d An ability that triggers at the beginning of a step or phase may trigger multiple times if it triggers
          at the beginning of “each player’s” or “each opponent’s” step or phase. These abilities trigger once for each
          appropriate player if the ability’s trigger condition, effect, or intervening “if” clause refers to “that
          player,” “that opponent,” or similar.</p>

        <p>805.5. Teams have priority, not individual players.</p>

        <p>805.5a A player may cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action when their team has priority.
        </p>

        <p>805.5b If a team has priority and no player on that team wishes to do anything, that team passes. If all
          teams pass in succession (that is, if all teams pass without any player taking any actions in between
          passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives priority. If the stack is empty
          when all teams pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.</p>

        <p>805.6. The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 101.4) is modified if the shared team turns
          option is used. If multiple teams would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active
          team makes any choices required, then each nonactive team in turn order makes any choices required. If
          multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first each player on the active team
          makes any choices required in whatever order they like, then the players on each nonactive team in turn order
          do the same. Once all choices have been made, the actions happen simultaneously.</p>

        <p>805.6a If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a game that’s using the shared team turns
          option, first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs that player’s draws,
          then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>805.7. If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time a team received priority, the
          members of the active team put all triggered abilities any of them controls on the stack in any order they
          choose, then the members of each nonactive team in turn order do the same.</p>

        <p>805.8. If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that player’s turn, that player’s
          team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that
          player’s team does so. If a single effect causes more than one player on the same team to add or skip the same
          step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips only that step, phase, or turn. If an effect causes a player to
          control another player, the first player controls the affected player’s team.</p>

        <p>805.9. Any ability that refers to the “active player” refers to one specific active player, not to all of the
          active players. The ability’s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is
          applied.</p>

        <p>805.10. The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.</p>

        <p>805.10a Each team’s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is
          the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is
          the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.</p>

        <p>805.10b As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. For each attacking
          creature, the attacking team announces which defending player or planeswalker that creature is attacking. The
          active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule
          508.1.</p>

        <p>805.10c Any rule, object, or effect that refers to an “attacking player” refers to one specific attacking
          player, not to all attacking players. If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a
          spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified,
          the attacking player it’s referring to is the player who controls the attacking creature that blocking
          creature is blocking. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate
          attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple
          attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.</p>

        <p>805.10d As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by
          the defending players can block creatures attacking any player on the defending team or attacking a
          planeswalker controlled by one of those players. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of
          blocking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 509.1.</p>

        <p>805.10e Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending
          player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending
          player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless
          otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the
          controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the
          defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat
          or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a
          spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually
          determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be
          chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.</p>

        <p>805.10f Once blockers have been declared, for each attacking creature that’s become blocked by multiple
          creatures, the active team announces the damage assignment order among the blocking creatures. Then, for each
          creature that’s blocking multiple creatures, the defending team announces the damage assignment order among
          the attacking creatures.</p>

        <p>805.10g As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign
          its combat damage. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage.
          See rule 510.1.</p>

          806. Free-for-All Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>806.1. In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as individuals against each other.</p>

        <p>806.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Free-for-All variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>806.2a The limited range of influence option usually isn’t used in Free-for-All games. If it is, each player
          has the same range of influence, which is determined before play begins. See rule 801, “Limited Range of
          Influence Option.”</p>

        <p>806.2b Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See
          rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”</p>

        <p>806.2c The deploy creatures option isn’t used in the Free-for-All variant.</p>

        <p>806.3. The players are randomly seated around the table.</p>

        <h2 id="807">
          807. Grand Melee Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>807.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players
          compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more
          players.</p>

        <p>807.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>807.2a Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 801).</p>

        <p>807.2b The attack left option is used (see rule 803).</p>

        <p>807.2c The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren’t used in the Grand Melee variant.</p>

        <p>807.3. The players are seated at random.</p>

        <p>807.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers
          keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn.
        </p>

        <p>807.4a There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.</p>
        <p>Example: A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers. A game with fifteen players has three
          turn markers.</p>

        <p>807.4b The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that player’s
          left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed
          out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns
          at the same time.</p>

        <p>807.4c After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a
          player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker
          after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to
          their left takes the turn marker immediately.</p>

        <p>807.4d A player who receives a turn marker can’t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their
          left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes
          the other turn marker.</p>

        <p>807.4e If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers
          in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player’s right is designated for removal. If more
          than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn
          markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest
          number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.</p>

        <p>807.4f For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of
          turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.</p>

        <p>807.4g If a player who’s taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker
          is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player who’s not taking a turn has a turn
          marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker
          had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal
          that many times minus one.</p>

        <p>807.4h If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of
          those seats don’t enter one another’s range of influence until the next turn begins.</p>

        <p>807.4i If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that
          player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn
          marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s left,
          the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn
          marker is within three seats on the player’s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the
          turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.
        </p>

        <p>807.4j If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player
          wouldn’t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before
          their next turn instead.</p>
        <p>Example: During Alex’s turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one.
          During the same turn, the player to Alex’s left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be
          reduced. After Alex’s current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He won’t take the extra turn from Time
          Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker.</p>

        <p>807.5. Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker
          represents its own stack.</p>

        <p>807.5a A player gets priority for a particular turn marker’s stack only if the turn marker is within their
          range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.</p>

        <p>807.5b If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered
          ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put
          on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on
          that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a
          copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one
          of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it can’t target objects on multiple stacks.
        </p>

          808. Team vs. Team Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>808.1. Team vs. Team games are played with two or more teams. Each team may have any number of players on it.
        </p>

        <p>808.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players
          sit.</p>

        <p>808.3. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Team vs. Team variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>808.3a The attack multiple players option is used (see rule 802).</p>

        <p>808.3b The deploy creatures options and limited range of influence options usually aren’t used in the Team
          vs. Team variant.</p>

        <p>808.4. To determine which player goes first, randomly choose a team. If that team has an odd number of
          players, the player in its center seat goes first. If that team has an even number of players, the player to
          the left of its midpoint goes first. Turn order goes to the players’ left.</p>

        <p>808.5. In the Team vs. Team variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared.
          Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each
          other’s cards or permanents.</p>

        <h2 id="809">
          809. Emperor Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>809.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.</p>

        <p>809.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which it’s seated.
          Each team has one emperor, who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals
          whose job is to protect the emperor.</p>

        <p>809.3. The Emperor variant uses the following default options.</p>

        <p>809.3a The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for generals. See rule 801, “Limited Range
          of Influence Option.”</p>

        <p>809.3b Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 804).</p>

        <p>809.3c A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to them.</p>
        <p>Example: At the start of an Emperor game, neither emperor can attack any opponents, even though both of the
          opposing generals are within their spell range.</p>

        <p>809.4. Randomly determine which emperor goes first. Turn order goes to the players’ left.</p>

        <p>809.5. The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for winning and losing the game. All other
          rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)</p>

        <p>809.5a A team wins the game if its emperor wins.</p>

        <p>809.5b A team loses the game if its emperor loses.</p>

        <p>809.5c The game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor.</p>

        <p>809.6. The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more
          than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.</p>

        <p>809.6a Each general’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows one general from an
          opposing team to begin the game within their range of influence. Each emperor’s range of influence should be
          the minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the game within their range of
          influence. Players should be seated such that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of
          another emperor.</p>
        <p>Example: In an Emperor game between two teams of four players each, the player configuration (either
          clockwise or counterclockwise around the table) should be: Team A general 1, Team A emperor, Team A general 2,
          Team A general 3, Team B general 1, Team B emperor, Team B general 2, Team B general 3. Each emperor has range
          of influence 3. Each general 2 has range of influence 2. Each general 1 and general 3 has range of influence
          1.</p>

        <p>809.7. In the Emperor variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates
          may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s
          cards or permanents.</p>

        <h2 id="810">
          810. Two-Headed Giant Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>810.1. Two-Headed Giant games are played with two teams of two players each.</p>

        <p>810.2. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the shared team turns option. (See rule 805.)</p>

        <p>810.3. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players
          sit.</p>

        <p>810.4. Each team has a shared life total, which starts at 30 life.</p>

        <p>810.5. With the exception of life total and poison counters, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so
          on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant. Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss
          strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.</p>

        <p>810.6. The team who plays first skips the draw step of its first turn.</p>

        <p>810.7. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the combat rules for the shared team turns option (see rule 805.10).
          This is a change from previous rules.</p>

        <p>810.8. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 104), with
          the following additions and specifications.</p>

        <p>810.8a Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the
          game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an
          effect says that a player can’t win the game, that player’s team can’t win the game. If an effect says that a
          player can’t lose the game, that player’s team can’t lose the game.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence, which reads, in part, “You don’t lose
          the game for having 0 or less life.” If that player’s team’s life total is 0 or less, that team doesn’t lose
          the game.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card while there are no cards in that
          player’s library. That player loses the game, so that player’s entire team loses the game.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel, which reads, “You can’t lose the game
          and your opponents can’t win the game.” Neither that player nor their teammate can lose the game while
          Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the opposing team can win the game.</p>

        <p>810.8b If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.</p>

        <p>810.8c If a team’s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule
          704.)</p>

        <p>810.8d If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based
          action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>810.9. Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to
          the team’s shared life total.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which reads, “Flame Rift deals 4 damage to
          each player.” Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.</p>

        <p>810.9a If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual player’s life total, that cost or effect
          uses the team’s life total instead.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 17 life is targeted by Beacon of
          Immortality, which reads, in part, “Double target player’s life total.” That player gains 17 life, so the team
          winds up at 34 life.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, “At the
          beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.” At the beginning of that player’s
          upkeep, the player’s team wins the game if their team’s life total is 50 or more.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 11 life controls Lurking Evil, an
          enchantment that reads, “Pay half your life, rounded up: Lurking Evil becomes a 4/4 Horror creature with
          flying.” To activate the ability, that player must pay 6 life. The team winds up at 5 life.</p>

        <p>810.9b If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life
          they pay may not exceed their team’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)</p>

        <p>810.9c If an effect sets a single player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the
          necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The team’s life total is adjusted by the amount of life
          that player gained or lost.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life is targeted by an ability that
          reads, “Target player’s life total becomes 10.” That player’s life total is considered to be 25, so that
          player loses 15 life. The team winds up at 10 life.</p>

        <p>810.9d If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of
          its members. On that team, only that player is affected.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, one team has 7 life and the other team has 13 life. A player casts Repay
          in Kind, which reads, “Each player’s life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.” Each team
          chooses one of its members to be affected. The result is that the chosen player on the team that has 13 life
          loses 6 life, so that team’s life total winds up at 7.</p>

        <p>810.9e A player can’t exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the
          exchange won’t happen.</p>

        <p>810.9f If an effect instructs a player to redistribute any number of players’ life totals, that player may
          not affect more than one member of each team this way.</p>

        <p>810.9g If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, no player on that player’s team can gain life.</p>

        <p>810.9h If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, no player on that player’s team can lose life or pay
          any amount of life other than 0.</p>

        <p>810.10. Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison
          counters are shared by the team.</p>

        <p>810.10a If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the
          number of poison counters that player’s team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a
          player’s opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.</p>

        <p>810.10b If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player’s team loses that many poison
          counters.</p>

        <p>810.10c If an effect says that a player can’t get poison counters, no player on that player’s team can get
          poison counters.</p>

        <p>810.10d If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses
          the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that player’s team has. A player is “poisoned”
          if that player’s team has one or more poison counters.</p>

        <p>810.11. The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players.
          For each player a team has beyond the second, that team’s starting life total is increased by 15 and the
          number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called
          Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)</p>

          811. Alternating Teams Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>811.1. Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.</p>

        <p>811.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>811.2a The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”</p>

        <p>811.2b Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See
          rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”</p>

        <p>811.2c The deploy creatures option isn’t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.</p>

        <p>811.3. At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is
          equally spaced out.</p>
        <p>Example: In an Alternating Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around the table at the
          start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, and so on.</p>

        <p>811.4. A player can’t attack opponents who aren’t seated next to them.</p>

        <p>811.5. In the Alternating Teams variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared.
          Teammates can’t review each other’s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss
          strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.</p>
