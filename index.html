        Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules

        These rules are effective as of September 25, 2020.

        <p>
          This document is the ultimate authority for Magic: The GatheringÂ® competitive game play. It consists of a
          series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and
          each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number. (Note that subrules skip the letters âlâ and
          âoâ due to potential confusion with the numbers â1â and â0â; subrule 704.5k is followed by 704.5m, then
          704.5n, then 704.5p, for example.)

        <p>100.1. These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and
          multiplayer games.</p>
        <p>100.1a A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.</p>
        <p>100.1b A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section 8, âMultiplayer
          Rules.â</p>
        <p>100.2. To play, each player needs their own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any
          tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.</p>
        <p>100.2a In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each
          deck has a minimum deck size of 60 cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no
          more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards.</p>
        <p>100.2b In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic
          product such as booster packs and creates their own deck using only this product and basic land cards), each
          deck has a minimum deck size of 40 cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are
          included with the product.</p>
        <p>100.2c Commander decks are subject to additional deckbuilding restrictions and requirements. See rule 903,
          âCommander,â for details.</p>

        <p>100.3. Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional
          Magic cards, and dice. See section 9, âCasual Variants.â</p>

        <p>100.4. Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to
          modify their deck between games of a match.</p>

        <p>100.4a In constructed play, a sideboard may contain no more than fifteen cards. The four-card limit (see rule
          100.2a) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.</p>

        <p>100.4b In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a playerâs card pool not included in their
          deck are in that playerâs sideboard.</p>

        <p>100.4c In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, all cards in a teamâs card pool
          but not in either playerâs deck are in that teamâs sideboard.</p>

        <p>100.4d In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card in a teamâs card pool but not in
          any playerâs deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has their own sideboard;
          cards may not be transferred between players.</p>

        <p>100.5. If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum
          deck size. There is no maximum deck size for non-Commander decks.</p>

        <p>100.6. Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win
          prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at
          WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring
          all cards from some older sets.</p>

        <p>100.6a Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until
          one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.</p>

        <p>100.6b Players can use the Magic Store & Event Locator at Wizards.com/Locator to find tournaments in their
          area.</p>

        <p>100.7. Certain promotional cards and cards in the Unglued, Unhinged, and Unstable sets are printed with a
          silver border. These cards are intended for casual play and may have features and text that arenât covered by
          these rules.</p>

        <h2 id="101">101. The Magic Golden Rules</h2>
        </p>
        <hr>

        <p>101.1. Whenever a cardâs text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides
          only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the
          game at any time (see rule 104.3a).</p>

        <p>101.2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it canât
          happen, the âcanâtâ effect takes precedence.</p>
        <p>Example: If one effect reads âYou may play an additional land this turnâ and another reads âYou canât play
          lands this turn,â the effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.</p>

        <p>101.2a Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects donât fall under this rule. (See rule
          113.10.)</p>

        <p>101.3. Any part of an instruction thatâs impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will
          specify consequences for this; if it doesnât, thereâs no effect.)</p>

        <p>101.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the
          player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player
          seated to the active playerâs left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in
          turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the âActive Player,
          Nonactive Player (APNAP) orderâ rule.</p>
        <p>Example: A card reads âEach player sacrifices a creature.â First, the active player chooses a creature they
          control. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses a creature they control. Then all
          creatures chosen this way are sacrificed simultaneously.</p>

        <p>101.4a If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as their hand or library, those
          cards may remain face down as theyâre chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card
          they are choosing.</p>

        <p>101.4b A player knows the choices made by the previous players when making their choice, except as specified
          in 101.4a.</p>

        <p>101.4c If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the
          order specified. If no order is specified, the player chooses the order.</p>

        <p>101.4d If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player
          earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.</p>

        <p>101.4e If multiple players would make choices or take actions while starting the game, the starting player is
          considered the active player and each other player is considered a nonactive player.</p>

        <p>
        <h2 id="102">102. Players</h2>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other
          players are nonactive players.</p>

        <p>102.2. In a two-player game, a playerâs opponent is the other player.</p>

        <p>102.3. In a multiplayer game between teams, a playerâs teammates are the other players on their team, and the
          playerâs opponents are all players not on their team.</p>

        <p>102.4. A spell or ability may use the term âyour teamâ as shorthand for âyou and/or your teammates.â In a
          game that isnât a multiplayer game between teams, âyour teamâ means the same thing as âyou.â</p>

        <h2 id="103">
          103. Starting the Game
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>103.1. At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn.
          In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable
          method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous
          game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that
          game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The
          gameâs default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.</p>

        <p>103.1a In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.
        </p>

        <p>103.1b In an Archenemy game, these methods arenât used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the
          archenemy takes the first turn.</p>

        <p>103.1c One card (Power Play) states that its controller is the starting player. This effect applies after
          this determination has happened and supersedes these methods.</p>

        <p>103.2. After the starting player has been determined, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are
          in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponentsâ decks. The playersâ decks become their
          libraries.</p>

        <p>103.2a If a player is using a sideboard (see rule 100.4) or cards being represented by substitute cards (see
          rule 713), those cards are set aside before shuffling.</p>

        <p>103.2b If a player wishes to reveal a card with a companion ability that they own from outside the game, they
          may do so after setting aside their sideboard. A player may reveal no more than one card this way, and they
          may do so only if their deck fulfills the condition of that cardâs companion ability. (See rule 702.138,
          âCompanion.â)</p>

        <p>103.2c In a Commander game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone
          after having the opportunity to reveal a card with a companion ability and before shuffling. See rule 903.6.
        </p>

        <p>103.2d In a Conspiracy Draft game, each player puts any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into
          the command zone before shuffling. See rule 905.4.</p>

        <p>103.3. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different
          starting life totals.</p>

        <p>103.3a In a Two-Headed Giant game, each teamâs starting life total is 30.</p>

        <p>103.3b In a Vanguard game, each playerâs starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their
          vanguard card.</p>

        <p>103.3c In a Commander game, each playerâs starting life total is 40.</p>

        <p>103.3d In a two-player Brawl game, each playerâs starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each
          playerâs starting life total is 30.</p>

        <p>103.3e In an Archenemy game, the archenemyâs starting life total is 40.</p>

        <p>103.4. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some
          effects can modify a playerâs starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may
          take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player
          in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take
          mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into
          their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards
          equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order.
          Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that playerâs opening hand, and that
          player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A
          player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further
          mulligans.</p>

        <p>103.4a In a Vanguard game, each playerâs starting hand size is seven plus or minus the hand modifier of their
          vanguard card.</p>

        <p>103.4b If an effect allows a player to perform an action âany time [that player] could mulligan,â the player
          may perform that action at a time they would declare whether they will take a mulligan. This need not be in
          the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the
          player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, they then declare whether
          they will take a mulligan.</p>

        <p>103.4c In a multiplayer game and in any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesnât count toward
          the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player
          may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>

        <p>103.4d In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team
          declares whether that player will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the
          same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A
          player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand.</p>

        <p>103.5. Some cards allow a player to take actions with them from their opening hand. Once the mulligan process
          (see rule 103.4) is complete, the starting player may take any such actions in any order. Then each other
          player in turn order may do the same.</p>

        <p>103.5a If a card allows a player to begin the game with that card on the battlefield, the player taking this
          action puts that card onto the battlefield.</p>

        <p>103.5b If a card allows a player to reveal it from their opening hand, the player taking this action does so.
          The card remains revealed until the first turn begins. Each card may be revealed this way only once.</p>

        <p>103.5c In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team, in
          whatever order that team likes, may take such actions. Teammates may consult while making their decisions.
          Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>103.6. In a Planechase game, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck
          and turns it face up. If itâs a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck
          and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. The face-up plane card becomes the starting
          plane. (See rule 901, âPlanechase.â)</p>

        <p>103.7. The starting player takes their first turn.</p>

        <p>103.7a In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule 504, âDraw Stepâ) of
          their first turn.</p>

        <p>103.7b In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn.</p>

        <p>103.7c In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of their first turn.</p>

        <h2 id="104">
          104. Ending the Game
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>104.1. A game ends immediately when a player wins, when the game is a draw, or when the game is restarted.
        </p>

        <p>104.2. There are several ways to win the game.</p>

        <p>104.2a A player still in the game wins the game if that playerâs opponents have all left the game. This
          happens immediately and overrides all effects that would preclude that player from winning the game.</p>

        <p>104.2b An effect may state that a player wins the game.</p>

        <p>104.2c In a multiplayer game between teams, a team with at least one player still in the game wins the game
          if all other teams have left the game. Each player on the winning team wins the game, even if one or more of
          those players had previously lost that game.</p>

        <p>104.2d In an Emperor game, a team wins the game if its emperor wins the game. (See rule 809.5.)</p>

        <p>104.3. There are several ways to lose the game.</p>

        <p>104.3a A player can concede the game at any time. A player who concedes leaves the game immediately. That
          player loses the game.</p>

        <p>104.3b If a playerâs life total is 0 or less, that player loses the game the next time a player would receive
          priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>104.3c If a player is required to draw more cards than are left in their library, they draw the remaining
          cards and then lose the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See
          rule 704.)</p>

        <p>104.3d If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game the next time a player would
          receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>104.3e An effect may state that a player loses the game.</p>

        <p>104.3f If a player would both win and lose the game simultaneously, that player loses the game.</p>

        <p>104.3g In a multiplayer game between teams, a team loses the game if all players on that team have lost the
          game.</p>

        <p>104.3h In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801), an effect that
          states that a player wins the game instead causes all of that playerâs opponents within the playerâs range of
          influence to lose the game. This may not cause the game to end.</p>

        <p>104.3i In an Emperor game, a team loses the game if its emperor loses the game. (See rule 809.5.)</p>

        <p>104.3j In a Commander game, a player thatâs been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over
          the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704. See also rule 903.10.)</p>

        <p>104.3k In a tournament, a player may lose the game as a result of a penalty given by a judge. See rule 100.6.
        </p>

        <p>104.4. There are several ways for the game to be a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4a If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4b If a game thatâs not using the limited range of influence option (including a two-player game) somehow
          enters a âloopâ of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw.
          Loops that contain an optional action donât result in a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4c An effect may state that the game is a draw.</p>

        <p>104.4d In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw if all remaining teams lose simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>104.4e In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, the effect of a spell or ability
          that states that the game is a draw causes the game to be a draw for that spell or abilityâs controller and
          all players within their range of influence. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all
          other players.</p>

        <p>104.4f In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, if the game somehow enters a âloopâ
          of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player
          who controls an object thatâs involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence
          of any of those players. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all other players.</p>

        <p>104.4g In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for all
          remaining players on that team.</p>

        <p>104.4h In the Emperor variant, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor. (See rule
          809.5.)</p>

        <p>104.4i In a tournament, all players in the game may agree to an intentional draw. See rule 100.6.</p>

        <p>104.5. If a player loses the game, that player leaves the game. If the game is a draw for a player, that
          player leaves the game. The multiplayer rules handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see rule
          800.4.</p>

        <p>104.6. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. All players still in the game when it restarts then
          immediately begin a new game. See rule 719, âRestarting the Game.â</p>

        <h2 id="105">
          105. Colors
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>105.1. There are five colors in the Magic game: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>

        <p>105.2. An object can be one or more of the five colors, or it can be no color at all. An object is the color
          or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame. An objectâs color or
          colors may also be defined by a color indicator or a characteristic-defining ability. See rule 202.2.</p>

        <p>105.2a A monocolored object is exactly one of the five colors.</p>

        <p>105.2b A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors.</p>

        <p>105.2c A colorless object has no color.</p>

        <p>105.3. Effects may change an objectâs color or give a color to a colorless object. If an effect gives an
          object a new color, the new color replaces all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the
          object became that color âin additionâ to its other colors). Effects may also make a colored object become
          colorless.</p>

        <p>105.4. If a player is asked to choose a color, they must choose one of the five colors. âMulticoloredâ is not
          a color. Neither is âcolorless.â</p>

        <p>105.5. If an effect refers to a color pair, it means exactly two of the five colors. There are ten color
          pairs: white and blue, white and black, blue and black, blue and red, black and red, black and green, red and
          green, red and white, green and white, and green and blue.</p>

        <h2 id="106">
          106. Mana
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>106.1. Mana is the primary resource in the game. Players spend mana to pay costs, usually when casting spells
          and activating abilities.</p>

        <p>106.1a There are five colors of mana: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>

        <p>106.1b There are six types of mana: white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.</p>

        <p>106.2. Mana is represented by mana symbols (see rule 107.4). Mana symbols also represent mana costs (see rule
          202).</p>

        <p>106.3. Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule 605). It may also be produced by the
          effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that arenât mana abilities. A spell or ability that
          produces mana instructs a player to add that mana.</p>

        <p>106.4. When an effect instructs a player to add mana, that mana goes into a playerâs mana pool. From there,
          it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the playerâs mana pool as unspent mana. Each
          playerâs mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase, and the player is said to lose this mana. Cards
          with abilities that produce mana or refer to unspent mana have received errata in the Oracleâ¢ card reference
          to no longer explicitly refer to the mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.4a If any mana remains in a playerâs mana pool after mana is spent to pay a cost, that player announces
          what mana is still there.</p>

        <p>106.4b If a player passes priority (see rule 117) while there is mana in their mana pool, that player
          announces what mana is there.</p>

        <p>106.5. If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.</p>
        <p>Example: Meteor Crater has the ability â{T}: Choose a color of a permanent you control. Add one mana of that
          color.â If you control no colored permanents, activating Meteor Craterâs mana ability produces no mana.</p>

        <p>106.6. Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, have an additional
          effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on, or create a delayed triggered ability (see
          rule 603.7a) that triggers when that mana is spent. This doesnât affect the manaâs type.</p>
        <p>Example: A playerâs mana pool contains {R}{G} which can be spent only to cast creature spells. That player
          activates Doubling Cubeâs ability, which reads â{3}, {T}: Double the amount of each type of unspent mana you
          have.â The playerâs mana pool now has {R}{R}{G}{G} in it, {R}{G} of which can be spent on anything.</p>

        <p>106.6a Some replacement effects increase the amount of mana produced by a spell or ability. In these cases,
          any restrictions or additional effects created by the spell or ability will apply to all mana produced. If the
          spell or ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the mana is spent, a separate delayed
          triggered ability is created for each mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a continuous effect or
          replacement effect if the mana is spent, a separate effect is created once for each mana produced.</p>

        <p>106.7. Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents âcould produce.â
          The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that
          permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable
          replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid.
          If that permanent wouldnât produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this
          way, thereâs no type of mana it could produce.</p>
        <p>Example: Exotic Orchard has the ability â{T}: Add one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls
          could produce.â If your opponent controls no lands, activating Exotic Orchardâs mana ability will produce no
          mana. The same is true if you and your opponent each control no lands other than Exotic Orchards. However, if
          you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard, then each Exotic
          Orchard could produce {G}.</p>

        <p>106.8. If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a playerâs mana pool, that player
          chooses one half of that symbol. If a colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that playerâs
          mana pool. If a generic half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana represented by that halfâs number is added
          to that playerâs mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.9. If an effect would add mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol to a playerâs mana pool, one mana
          of the color of that symbol is added to that playerâs mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.10. If an effect would add mana represented by a generic mana symbol to a playerâs mana pool, that much
          colorless mana is added to that playerâs mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.11. If an effect would add mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols to a playerâs mana pool,
          that much colorless mana is added to that playerâs mana pool.</p>

        <p>106.12. To âtap [a permanent] for manaâ is to activate a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T}
          symbol in its activation cost. See rule 605, âMana Abilities.â</p>

        <p>106.12a An ability that triggers whenever a permanent âis tapped for manaâ or is tapped for mana of a
          specified type triggers whenever such a mana ability resolves and produces mana or the specified type of mana.
        </p>

        <p>106.12b A replacement effect that applies if a permanent âis tapped for manaâ or tapped for mana of a
          specific type and/or amount modifies the mana production event while such an ability is resolving and
          producing mana or the specified type and/or amount of mana.</p>

        <p>106.13. One card (Drain Power) causes one player to lose unspent mana and another to add âthe mana lost this
          way.â (Note that these may be the same player.) This empties the former playerâs mana pool and causes the mana
          emptied this way to be put into the latter playerâs mana pool. Which permanents, spells, and/or abilities
          produced that mana are unchanged, as are any restrictions or additional effects associated with any of that
          mana.</p>

          107. Numbers and Symbols
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>107.1. The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.</p>

        <p>107.1a You canât choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a
          spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or
          down.</p>

        <p>107.1b Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You canât choose a negative
          number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, itâs possible for a game value, such as
          a creatureâs power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it
          does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used
          instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a playerâs life total or the power and/or
          toughness of a creature or creature card.</p>
        <p>Example: If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, itâs a -2/4 creature. It doesnât assign damage in combat. Its total
          power and toughness is 2. Giving it +3/+0 would raise its power to 1.</p>
        <p>Example: Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature with the ability â{T}: Add an amount of {G} equal to Viridian
          Joinerâs power.â An effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated. The ability adds no mana to your
          mana pool.</p>
        <p>Example: Chameleon Colossus is a 4/4 creature with the ability â{2}{G}{G}: Chameleon Colossus gets +X/+X
          until end of turn, where X is its power.â An effect gives it -6/-0, then its ability is activated. It remains
          a -2/4 creature. It doesnât become -4/2.</p>

        <p>107.1c If a rule or ability instructs a player to choose âany number,â that player may choose any positive
          number or zero.</p>

        <p>107.2. If anything needs to use a number that canât be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it
          uses 0 instead.</p>

        <p>107.3. Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects
          have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.</p>

        <p>107.3a If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation
          cost with an {X}, [-X], or X in it, and the value of X isnât defined by the text of that spell or ability, the
          controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X as part of casting the spell or
          activating the ability. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana
          cost or in any alternative cost or additional cost it has equals the announced value. While an activated
          ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.</p>

        <p>107.3b If a player is casting a spell that has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of X isnât defined by the
          text of that spell, and an effect lets that player cast that spell while paying neither its mana cost nor an
          alternative cost that includes X, then the only legal choice for X is 0. This doesnât apply to effects that
          only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â</p>

        <p>107.3c If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X
          is defined by the text of that spell or ability, then thatâs the value of X while that spell or ability is on
          the stack. The controller of that spell or ability doesnât get to choose the value. Note that the value of X
          may change while that spell or ability is on the stack.</p>

        <p>107.3d If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X
          in it, the value of X is chosen by the player taking the special action immediately before they pay that cost.
        </p>

        <p>107.3e If a spell or ability refers to the {X} or X in the mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or
          activation cost of another object, any X in that spell or abilityâs text uses the value of X chosen or defined
          for the other object.</p>

        <p>107.3f Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a mana cost, alternative cost,
          additional cost, or activation cost. If the value of X isnât defined, the controller of the spell or ability
          chooses the value of X at the appropriate time (either as itâs put on the stack or as it resolves).</p>

        <p>107.3g If a card in any zone other than the stack has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of {X} is treated as
          0, even if the value of X is defined somewhere within its text.</p>

        <p>107.3h If an effect instructs a player to pay an objectâs mana cost that includes {X}, the value of X is
          treated as 0 unless the object is a spell on the stack. In that case, the value of X is the value chosen or
          determined for it as the spell was cast.</p>

        <p>107.3i Normally, all instances of X on an object have the same value at any given time.</p>

        <p>107.3j If an object gains an ability, the value of X within that ability is the value defined by that
          ability, or 0 if that ability doesnât define a value of X. This is an exception to rule 107.3i. This may occur
          with ability-adding effects, text-changing effects, or copy effects.</p>

        <p>107.3k If an objectâs activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its activation cost, the value of X for
          that ability is independent of any other values of X chosen for that object or for other instances of
          abilities of that object. This is an exception to rule 107.3i.</p>

        <p>107.3m If an objectâs enters-the-battlefield triggered ability or replacement effect refers to X, and the
          spell that became that object as it resolved had a value of X chosen for any of its costs, the value of X for
          that ability is the same as the value of X for that spell, although the value of X for that permanent is 0.
          This is an exception to rule 107.3i.</p>

        <p>107.3n Some objects use the letter Y in addition to the letter X. Y follows the same rules as X.</p>

        <p>107.4. The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {C}; the numerical symbols {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4},
          and so on; the variable symbol {X}; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W},
          {G/W}, and {G/U}; the monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, and {2/G}; the Phyrexian mana
          symbols {W/P}, {U/P}, {B/P}, {R/P}, and {G/P}; and the snow symbol {S}.</p>

        <p>107.4a There are five primary colored mana symbols: {W} is white, {U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G}
          green. These symbols are used to represent colored mana, and also to represent colored mana in costs. Colored
          mana in costs can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. See rule 202, âMana Cost and Color.â</p>

        <p>107.4b Numerical symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X}) represent generic mana in costs.
          Generic mana in costs can be paid with any type of mana. For more information about {X}, see rule 107.3.</p>

        <p>107.4c The colorless mana symbol {C} is used to represent one colorless mana, and also to represent a cost
          that can be paid only with one colorless mana.</p>

        <p>107.4d The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder for a cost that can be paid with no
          resources. (See rule 118.5.)</p>

        <p>107.4e Hybrid mana symbols are also colored mana symbols. Each one represents a cost that can be paid in one
          of two ways, as represented by the two halves of the symbol. A hybrid symbol such as {W/U} can be paid with
          either white or blue mana, and a monocolored hybrid symbol such as {2/B} can be paid with either one black
          mana or two mana of any type. A hybrid mana symbol is all of its component colors.</p>
        <p>Example: {G/W}{G/W} can be paid by spending {G}{G}, {G}{W}, or {W}{W}.</p>

        <p>107.4f Phyrexian mana symbols are colored mana symbols: {W/P} is white, {U/P} is blue, {B/P} is black, {R/P}
          is red, and {G/P} is green. A Phyrexian mana symbol represents a cost that can be paid either with one mana of
          its color or by paying 2 life.</p>
        <p>Example: {W/P}{W/P} can be paid by spending {W}{W}, by spending {W} and paying 2 life, or by paying 4 life.
        </p>

        <p>107.4g In rules text, the Phyrexian symbol {P} with no colored background means any of the five Phyrexian
          mana symbols.</p>

        <p>107.4h The snow mana symbol {S} represents one mana in a cost. This mana can be paid with one mana of any
          type produced by a snow permanent (see rule 205.4g). Effects that reduce the amount of generic mana you pay
          donât affect {S} costs. Snow is neither a color nor a type of mana.</p>

        <p>107.5. The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means âTap this permanent.â A permanent
          thatâs already tapped canât be tapped again to pay the cost. A creatureâs activated ability with the tap
          symbol in its activation cost canât be activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâs control
          continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.</p>

        <p>107.6. The untap symbol is {Q}. The untap symbol in an activation cost means âUntap this permanent.â A
          permanent thatâs already untapped canât be untapped again to pay the cost. A creatureâs activated ability with
          the untap symbol in its activation cost canât be activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâs
          control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.</p>

        <p>107.7. Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost. Positive loyalty symbols
          point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature
          a minus sign followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols donât point in either direction and feature
          a 0. [+N] means âPut N loyalty counters on this permanent,â [-N] means âRemove N loyalty counters from this
          permanent,â and [0] means âPut zero loyalty counters on this permanent.â</p>

        <p>107.8. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that
          represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as âN1-N2,â
          or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as âN3+.â Any abilities printed within the same
          text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness
          box printed within that striation, indicated here as â[P/T].â See rule 710, âLeveler Cards.â</p>

        <p>107.8a â{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]â means âAs long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on
          it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].â</p>

        <p>107.8b â{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]â means âAs long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it,
          it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].â</p>

        <p>107.9. A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odysseyâ¢ block cards with abilities that are
          relevant in a playerâs graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when theyâre in a
          graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>107.10. A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the Future SightÂ® set printed with an
          alternate âtimeshiftedâ frame. If the card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks
          for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise for enchantment, a chalice for
          artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for land. If the card has multiple card types, thatâs indicated by a
          black and white cross. This icon has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>107.11. The Planeswalker symbol is {PW}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase
          casual variant. See rule 901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>107.12. The chaos symbol is {CHAOS}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual
          variant, as well as in abilities that refer to the results of rolling the planar die. See rule 901,
          âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>107.13. A color indicator is a circular symbol that appears to the left of the type line on some cards. The
          color of the symbol defines the cardâs color or colors. See rule 202, âMana Cost and Color.â</p>

        <p>107.14. The energy symbol is {E}. It represents one energy counter. To pay {E}, a player removes one energy
          counter from themselves.</p>

        <p>107.15. The text box of a Saga card contains chapter symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that
          represents a triggered ability. A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as ârNâ. The text
          printed in the text box striation to the right of a chapter symbol is the effect of the triggered ability it
          represents. See rule 714, âSaga Cards.â</p>

        <p>107.15a â{rN}â[Effect]â means âWhen one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore
          counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].â</p>

        <p>107.15b â{rN1}, {rN2}â[Effect]â is the same as â{rN1}â[Effect]â and â{rN2}â[Effect].â</p>

        <h2 id="108">
          108. Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>108.1. Use the Oracle card reference when determining a cardâs wording. A cardâs Oracle text can be found
          using the Gatherer card database at Gatherer.Wizards.com.</p>

        <p>108.2. When a rule or text on a card refers to a âcard,â it means only a Magic card or an object represented
          by a Magic card.</p>

        <p>108.2a Most Magic games use only traditional Magic cards, which measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by
          3.5 inches (8.8 cm). Certain formats also use nontraditional Magic cards, oversized cards that may have
          different backs.</p>

        <p>108.2b Tokens arenât considered cardsâeven a card-sized game supplement that represents a token isnât
          considered a card for rules purposes.</p>

        <p>108.3. The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. If a card is
          brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a playerâs deck, its owner is the player
          who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put
          it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game
          rules except for the rules for ante. (See rule 407.)</p>

        <p>108.3a In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be
          the owner of all cards in the planar deck. See rule 901.6.</p>

        <p>108.3b Some spells and abilities allow a player to take cards they own from outside the game and bring them
          into the game. (See rule 400.11b.) If a card outside that game is involved in a Magic game, its owner is
          determined as described in rule 108.3. If a card outside that game is in the sideboard of a Magic game (see
          rule 100.4), its owner is considered to be the player who started the game with it in their sideboard. In all
          other cases, the owner of a card outside the game is its legal owner.</p>

        <p>108.4. A card doesnât have a controller unless that card represents a permanent or spell; in those cases, its
          controller is determined by the rules for permanents or spells. See rules 110.2 and 112.2.</p>

        <p>108.4a If anything asks for the controller of a card that doesnât have one (because itâs not a permanent or
          spell), use its owner instead.</p>

        <p>108.5. Nontraditional Magic cards canât start the game in any zone other than the command zone (see rule
          408). If an effect would bring a nontraditional Magic card into the game from outside the game, it doesnât;
          that card remains outside the game.</p>

        <p>108.6. For more information about cards, see section 2, âParts of a Card.â</p>

          109. Objects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>109.1. An object is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a token, a spell, a permanent, or an
          emblem.</p>

        <p>109.2. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but
          doesnât include the word âcard,â âspell,â âsource,â or âscheme,â it means a permanent of that card type or
          subtype on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>109.2a If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word âcardâ and the name of a
          zone, it means a card matching that description in the stated zone.</p>

        <p>109.2b If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word âspell,â it means a spell
          matching that description on the stack.</p>

        <p>109.2c If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word âsource,â it means a
          source matching that descriptionâeither a source of an ability or a source of damageâin any zone. See rule
          609.7.</p>

        <p>109.2d If an ability of a scheme card includes the text âthis scheme,â it means the scheme card in the
          command zone on which that ability is printed.</p>

        <p>109.3. An objectâs characteristics are name, mana cost, color, color indicator, card type, subtype,
          supertype, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can
          have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isnât a characteristic. For
          example, characteristics donât include whether a permanent is tapped, a spellâs target, an objectâs owner or
          controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.</p>

        <p>109.4. Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the
          stack nor on the battlefield arenât controlled by any player. See rule 108.4. There are six exceptions to this
          rule:</p>

        <p>109.4a The controller of a mana ability is determined as though it were on the stack. See rule 605, âMana
          Abilities.â</p>

        <p>109.4b An emblem is controlled by the player that puts it into the command zone. See rule 114, âEmblems.â</p>

        <p>109.4c In a Planechase game, a face-up plane or phenomenon card is controlled by the player designated as the
          planar controller. This is usually the active player. See rule 901.6.</p>

        <p>109.4d In a Vanguard game, each vanguard card is controlled by its owner. See rule 902.6.</p>

        <p>109.4e In an Archenemy game, each scheme card is controlled by its owner. See rule 904.7.</p>

        <p>109.4f In a Conspiracy Draft game, each conspiracy card is controlled by its owner. See rule 905.5.</p>

        <p>109.5. The words âyouâ and âyourâ on an object refer to the objectâs controller, its would-be controller (if
          a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static
          ability, this is the current controller of the object itâs on. For an activated ability, this is the player
          who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability
          triggered, unless itâs a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered
          ability, see rules 603.7dâf.</p>

        <h2 id="110">
          110. Permanents
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>110.1. A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield
          indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent
          as itâs moved to another zone by an effect or rule.</p>

        <p>110.2. A permanentâs owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless itâs a token; see
          rule 111.2). A permanentâs controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the
          battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.</p>

        <p>110.2a If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the battlefield, that object enters the
          battlefield under that playerâs control unless the effect states otherwise.</p>

        <p>110.2b If an effect causes a player to gain control of another playerâs permanent spell, the first player
          controls the permanent that spell becomes, but the permanentâs controller by default is the player who put
          that spell onto the stack. (This distinction is relevant in multiplayer games; see rule 800.4c.)</p>

        <p>110.3. A nontoken permanentâs characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any
          continuous effects. See rule 613, âInteraction of Continuous Effects.â</p>

        <p>110.4. There are five permanent types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and
          sorcery cards canât enter the battlefield and thus canât be permanents. Some tribal cards can enter the
          battlefield and some canât, depending on their other card types. See section 3, âCard Types.â</p>

        <p>110.4a The term âpermanent cardâ is used to refer to a card that could be put onto the battlefield.
          Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.</p>

        <p>110.4b The term âpermanent spellâ is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent
          as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.
        </p>

        <p>110.4c If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on the battlefield. Itâs still a
          permanent.</p>

        <p>110.5. A permanentâs status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two
          possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each
          permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.</p>

        <p>110.5a Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanentâs characteristics.</p>

        <p>110.5b Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and phased in unless a spell or ability
          says otherwise.</p>

        <p>110.5c A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or turn-based action changes it, even if that
          status is not relevant to it.</p>
        <p>Example: Dimir Doppelganger says â{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger
          becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.â It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip card.
          Through use of Jushi Apprenticeâs ability, this creature flips, making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with
          the Dimir Doppelganger ability. If this permanent then becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear, it will retain its
          flipped status even though that has no relevance to Runeclaw Bear. If its copy ability is activated again,
          this time targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanentâs flipped status means it will
          have the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with the Dimir
          Doppelganger ability.</p>

        <p>110.5d Only permanents have status. Cards not on the battlefield do not. Although an exiled card may be face
          down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent. Similarly, cards not on the battlefield
          are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.</p>

        <h2 id="111">
          111. Tokens
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>111.1. Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that
          isnât represented by a card.</p>

        <p>111.2. The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters the battlefield under that playerâs
          control.</p>

        <p>111.3. The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for
          the token. This becomes the tokenâs âtext.â The characteristic values defined this way are functionally
          equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the tokenâs
          copiable values. A token doesnât have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Jade Mage has the ability â{2}{G}: Create a 1/1 green Saproling creature token.â The resulting token
          has no mana cost, supertypes, rules text, or abilities.</p>

        <p>111.4. A spell or ability that creates a token sets both its name and its subtype(s). If the spell or ability
          doesnât specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its subtype(s). A âGoblin Scout creature
          token,â for example, is named âGoblin Scoutâ and has the creature subtypes Goblin and Scout. Once a token is
          on the battlefield, changing its name doesnât change its subtype, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>111.5. If a spell or ability would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or
          more of that tokenâs characteristics canât enter the battlefield, the token is not created.</p>

        <p>111.6. A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the tokenâs card
          type or subtype. A token isnât a card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a
          Magic booster pack).</p>

        <p>111.7. A token thatâs in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see
          rule 704. (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token
          ceases to exist.)</p>

        <p>111.8. A token that has left the battlefield canât move to another zone or come back onto the battlefield. If
          such a token would change zones, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time
          state-based actions are checked; see rule 704.</p>

        <p>111.9. Some effects instruct a player to create a legendary token. These may be written âcreate [name], a . .
          .â and list characteristics for the token. This is the same as an instruction to create a token with the
          listed characteristics that has the given name.</p>

        <p>111.10. Some effects instruct a player to create a predefined token. These effects use the definition below
          to determine the characteristics the token is created with. The effect that creates a predefined token may
          also modify or add to the predefined characteristics.</p>

        <p>111.10a A Treasure token is a colorless Treasure artifact token with â{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one
          mana of any color.â</p>

        <p>111.10b A Food token is a colorless Food artifact token with â{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: You gain 3
          life.â</p>

        <p>111.10c A Gold token is a colorless Gold artifact token with âSacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any
          color.â</p>

        <p>111.11. A copy of a permanent spell becomes a token as it resolves. The token has the characteristics of the
          spell that became that token. The token is not âcreatedâ for the purposes of any replacement effects or
          triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.</p>

        <h2 id="112">
          112. Spells
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>112.1. A spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast (see rule 601, âCasting Spellsâ), the
          card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its
          ownerâs hand. (See rule 405, âStack.â) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule
          608, âResolving Spells and Abilitiesâ), is countered (see rule 701.5), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more
          information, see section 6, âSpells, Abilities, and Effects.â</p>

        <p>112.1a A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. See rule 706.10.</p>

        <p>112.1b Some effects allow a player to cast a copy of a card; if the player does, that copy is a spell as
          well. See rule 706.12.</p>

        <p>112.2. A spellâs owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless itâs a copy. In that
          case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spellâs controller
          is, by default, the player who put it on the stack. Every spell has a controller.</p>

        <p>112.3. A noncopy spellâs characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any
          continuous effects. See rule 613, âInteraction of Continuous Effects.â</p>

        <p>112.4. If an effect changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the
          permanent when the spell resolves. See rule 400.7.</p>
        <p>Example: If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the creature is white when it enters the
          battlefield and remains white for the duration of the effect changing its color.</p>

        <h2 id="113">
          113. Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>113.1. An ability can be one of three things:</p>

        <p>113.1a An ability can be a characteristic an object has that lets it affect the game. An objectâs abilities
          are defined by its rules text or by the effect that created it. Abilities can also be granted to objects by
          rules or effects. (Effects that grant abilities usually use the words âhas,â âhave,â âgains,â or âgain.â)
          Abilities generate effects. (See rule 609, âEffects.â)</p>

        <p>113.1b An ability can be something that a player has that changes how the game affects the player. A player
          normally has no abilities unless granted to that player by effects.</p>

        <p>113.1c An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. This kind of ability is an object.
          (See section 6, âSpells, Abilities, and Effects.â)</p>

        <p>113.2. Abilities can affect the objects theyâre on. They can also affect other objects and/or players.</p>

        <p>113.2a Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental.</p>
        <p>Example: â[This creature] canât blockâ is an ability.</p>

        <p>113.2b An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability of the card.</p>

        <p>113.2c An object may have multiple abilities. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain
          defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule 702, âKeyword Abilitiesâ), each
          paragraph break in a cardâs text marks a separate ability. If the object is not represented by a card, the
          effect that created it may have given it multiple abilities. An object may also be granted additional
          abilities by a spell or ability. If an object has multiple instances of the same ability, each instance
          functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the
          specific ability for more information.</p>

        <p>113.2d Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement
          effects or prevention effects. See rule 609, âEffects.â</p>

        <p>113.3. There are four general categories of abilities:</p>

        <p>113.3a Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions while an instant or sorcery spell is
          resolving. Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless itâs an activated ability, a
          triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule 113.6.</p>

        <p>113.3b Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as â[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation
          instructions (if any).]â A player may activate such an ability whenever they have priority. Doing so puts it
          on the stack, where it remains until itâs countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule
          602, âActivating Activated Abilities.â</p>

        <p>113.3c Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as â[Trigger condition],
          [effect],â and include (and usually begin with) the word âwhen,â âwhenever,â or âat.â Whenever the trigger
          event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there
          until itâs countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule 603, âHandling Triggered
          Abilities.â</p>

        <p>113.3d Static abilities are written as statements. Theyâre simply true. Static abilities create continuous
          effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or
          while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule 604, âHandling Static Abilities.â</p>

        <p>113.4. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow
          special rules: They donât use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana
          abilities even if they donât have priority. See rule 605, âMana Abilities.â</p>

        <p>113.5. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may
          activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty
          during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that
          permanent that turn. See rule 606, âLoyalty Abilities.â</p>

        <p>113.6. Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack.
          Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions
          are as follows:</p>

        <p>113.6a Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside the game. (See rule 604.3.)</p>

        <p>113.6b An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.</p>

        <p>113.6c An objectâs ability that allows a player to pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost or
          otherwise modifies what that particular object costs to cast functions on the stack.</p>

        <p>113.6d An objectâs ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast
          functions in any zone from which it could be played or cast and also on the stack. An objectâs ability that
          grants it another ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast
          functions only on the stack.</p>

        <p>113.6e An objectâs ability that restricts or modifies what zones that particular object can be played or cast
          from functions everywhere, even outside the game.</p>

        <p>113.6f An objectâs ability that states it canât be countered functions on the stack.</p>

        <p>113.6g An objectâs ability that modifies how that particular object enters the battlefield functions as that
          object is entering the battlefield. See rule 614.12.</p>

        <p>113.6h An objectâs ability that states counters canât be put on that object functions as that object is
          entering the battlefield in addition to functioning while that object is on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>113.6i An objectâs activated ability that has a cost that canât be paid while the object is on the
          battlefield functions from any zone in which its cost can be paid.</p>

        <p>113.6j A trigger condition that canât trigger from the battlefield functions in all zones it can trigger
          from. Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.</p>
        <p>Example: Absolver Thrull has the ability âWhen Absolver Thrull enters the battlefield or the creature it
          haunts dies, destroy target enchantment.â The first trigger condition functions from the battlefield and the
          second trigger condition functions from the exile zone. (See rule 702.54, âHaunt.â)</p>

        <p>113.6k An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object itâs on out of a particular zone
          functions only in that zone, unless its trigger condition or a previous part of its cost or effect specifies
          that the object is put into that zone or, if the object is an Aura, that the object it enchants leaves the
          battlefield. The same is true if the effect of that ability creates a delayed triggered ability whose effect
          moves the object out of a particular zone.</p>
        <p>Example: Reassembling Skeleton says â{1}{B}: Return Reassembling Skeleton from your graveyard to the
          battlefield tapped.â A player may activate this ability only if Reassembling Skeleton is in their graveyard.
        </p>

        <p>113.6m An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions before the game begins. Such an
          ability modifies not just the Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules and any
          other documents that set the deck construction rules for a specific format. However, such an ability canât
          affect the format legality of a card, including whether itâs banned or restricted. The current Magic: The

        <p>113.6n Abilities of emblems, plane cards, vanguard cards, scheme cards, and conspiracy cards function in the
          command zone. See rule 114, âEmblemsâ; rule 901, âPlanechaseâ; rule 902, âVanguardâ; rule 904, âArchenemyâ;
          and rule 905, âConspiracy Draft.â</p>

        <p>113.7. The source of an ability is the object that generated it. The source of an activated ability on the
          stack is the object whose ability was activated. The source of a triggered ability (other than a delayed
          triggered ability) on the stack, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put on the stack, is the
          object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7dâf.
        </p>

        <p>113.7a Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction
          or removal of the source after that time wonât affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to
          do something (for example, âProdigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any targetâ) rather than the ability doing
          anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the
          source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that
          information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it
          resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone itâs expected to be in at that time, its
          last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.</p>

        <p>113.8. The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of
          a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the
          abilityâs source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the abilityâs source
          when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7dâf.</p>

        <p>113.9. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack arenât spells, and therefore canât be countered by
          anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects
          that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities donât use the stack and thus canât be countered at all.
        </p>

        <p>113.10. Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the
          object âgainsâ or âhasâ that ability, or similar. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object
          âlosesâ that ability.</p>

        <p>113.10a An effect that adds an activated ability may include activation instructions for that ability. These
          instructions become part of the ability thatâs added to the object.</p>

        <p>113.10b Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.</p>

        <p>113.10c If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails. See
          rule 613 for more information about the interaction of continuous effects.</p>

        <p>113.11. Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object âcanât
          haveâ that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. Itâs also impossible for an effect to add
          that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the
          specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts
          of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other
          continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability wonât
          apply to that object.</p>

        <p>113.12. An effect that sets an objectâs characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is
          different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object âgainsâ or âhasâ an ability, that ability can
          be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (â[permanent] is
          [characteristic value]â), itâs not granting an ability. (See rule 604.3.) Similarly, if an effect states a
          quality of that object (â[creature] canât be blocked,â for example), itâs neither granting an ability nor
          setting a characteristic.</p>
        <p>Example: Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, âCreatures with no abilities get +2/+2.â A Runeclaw Bear (a creature
          with no abilities) enchanted by an Aura that says âEnchanted creature has flyingâ would not get +2/+2. A
          Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says âEnchanted creature is redâ or âEnchanted creature canât be
          blockedâ would get +2/+2.</p>

        <h2 id="114">
          114. Emblems
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>114.1. Some effects put emblems into the command zone. An emblem is a marker used to represent an object that
          has one or more abilities, but no other characteristics.</p>

        <p>114.2. An effect that creates an emblem is written â[Player] gets an emblem with [ability].â This means that
          [player] puts an emblem with [ability] into the command zone. The emblem is both owned and controlled by that
          player.</p>

        <p>114.3. An emblem has no characteristics other than the abilities defined by the effect that created it. In
          particular, an emblem has no name, no types, no mana cost, and no color.</p>

        <p>114.4. Abilities of emblems function in the command zone.</p>

        <p>114.5. An emblem is neither a card nor a permanent. Emblem isnât a card type.</p>

        <h2 id="115">
          115. Targets
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>115.1. Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets
          are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the
          process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets canât be changed except by another spell or
          ability that explicitly says it can do so.</p>

        <p>115.1a An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability identifies something it will affect by
          using the phrase âtarget [something],â where the âsomethingâ is a phrase that describes an object and/or
          player. The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule 601.2c. (If an activated or triggered ability
          of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not.)</p>
        <p>Example: A sorcery card has the ability âWhen you cycle this card, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of
          turn.â This triggered ability is targeted, but that doesnât make the card itâs on targeted.</p>

        <p>115.1b Aura spells are always targeted. An Auraâs target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see
          rule 702.5, âEnchantâ). The target is chosen as the spell is cast; see rule 601.2c. An Aura permanent doesnât
          target anything; only the spell is targeted. (An activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can also
          be targeted.)</p>

        <p>115.1c An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase âtarget
          [something],â where the âsomethingâ is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are
          chosen as the ability is activated; see rule 602.2b.</p>

        <p>115.1d A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase âtarget
          [something],â where the âsomethingâ is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are
          chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see rule 603.3d.</p>

        <p>115.1e Some keyword abilities, such as equip and modular, represent targeted activated or triggered
          abilities, and some keyword abilities, such as mutate, cause spells to have targets. In those cases, the
          phrase âtarget [something]â appears in the rule for that keyword ability rather than in the ability itself.
          (The keywordâs reminder text will often contain the word âtarget.â) See rule 702, âKeyword Abilities.â</p>

        <p>115.2. Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies
          that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or (b) targets an object that canât exist on the
          battlefield, such as a spell or ability. See also rule 115.4.</p>

        <p>115.3. The same target canât be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word âtargetâ on a spell or
          ability. If the spell or ability uses the word âtargetâ in multiple places, the same object or player can be
          chosen once for each instance of the word âtargetâ (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). This rule
          applies both when choosing targets for a spell or ability and when changing targets or choosing new targets
          for a spell or ability (see rule 115.7).</p>

        <p>115.4. Some spells and abilities that refer to damage require âany target,â âanother target,â âtwo targets,â
          or similar rather than âtarget [something].â These targets may be creatures, players, or planeswalkers. Other
          game objects, such as noncreature artifacts or spells, canât be chosen.</p>

        <p>115.5. A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.</p>

        <p>115.6. A spell or ability that requires targets may allow zero targets to be chosen. Such a spell or ability
          is still said to require targets, but that spell or ability is targeted only if one or more targets have been
          chosen for it.</p>

        <p>115.7. Some effects allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, and other effects allow a
          player to choose new targets for a spell or ability.</p>

        <p>115.7a If an effect allows a player to âchange the target(s)â of a spell or ability, each target can be
          changed only to another legal target. If a target canât be changed to another legal target, the original
          target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by then. If all the targets arenât changed
          to other legal targets, none of them are changed.</p>

        <p>115.7b If an effect allows a player to âchange a targetâ of a spell or ability, the process described in rule
          115.7a is followed, except that only one of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of
          them).</p>

        <p>115.7c If an effect allows a player to âchange any targetsâ of a spell or ability, the process described in
          rule 115.7a is followed, except that any number of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or
          none of them).</p>

        <p>115.7d If an effect allows a player to âchoose new targetsâ for a spell or ability, the player may leave any
          number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some
          or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal and must not cause any unchanged targets to become
          illegal.</p>

        <p>115.7e When changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability, only the final set of targets is
          evaluated to determine whether the change is legal.</p>
        <p>Example: Arc Trail is a sorcery that reads âArc Trail deals 2 damage to any target and 1 damage to another
          target.â The current targets of Arc Trail are Runeclaw Bear and Llanowar Elves, in that order. You cast
          Redirect, an instant that reads âYou may choose new targets for target spell,â targeting Arc Trail. You can
          change the first target to Llanowar Elves and change the second target to Runeclaw Bear.</p>

        <p>115.7f A spell or ability may âdivideâ or âdistributeâ an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or
          more targets. When changing targets or choosing new targets for that spell or ability, the original division
          canât be changed.</p>

        <p>115.8. Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that
          allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal
          spell or ability, doesnât allow that player to change its mode. (See rule 700.2.)</p>

        <p>115.9. Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may
          check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.</p>

        <p>115.9a An object that looks for a â[spell or ability] with a single targetâ checks the number of times any
          object or player was chosen as the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the
          number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object or player became a target more than once,
          each of those instances is counted separately.</p>

        <p>115.9b An object that looks for a â[spell or ability] that targets [something]â checks the current state of
          that spell or abilityâs targets. If an object it targets is still in the zone itâs expected to be in or a
          player it targets is still in the game, that targetâs current information is used, even if itâs not currently
          legal for that spell or ability. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone itâs expected to be in or a
          player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used.
        </p>

        <p>115.9c An object that looks for a â[spell or ability] that targets only [something]â checks the number of
          different objects or players that were chosen as targets of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack
          (as modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those objects or players that are
          currently legal targets. If that number is one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player
          multiple times), the current state of that spell or abilityâs target is checked as described in rule 115.9b.
        </p>

        <p>115.10. Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they donât target. In general, those objects and
          players arenât chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule 608, âResolving Spells and Abilities.â</p>

        <p>115.10a Just because an object or player is being affected by a spell or ability doesnât make that object or
          player a target of that spell or ability. Unless that object or player is identified by the word âtargetâ in
          the text of that spell or ability, or the rule for that keyword ability, itâs not a target.</p>

        <p>115.10b In particular, the word âyouâ in an objectâs text doesnât indicate a target.</p>

        <h2 id="116">
          116. Special Actions
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>116.1. Special actions are actions a player may take when they have priority that donât use the stack. These
          are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates
          automatically. (See rule 703, âTurn-Based Actions,â and rule 704, âState-Based Actions.â)</p>

        <p>116.2. There are nine special actions:</p>

        <p>116.2a Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from
          the zone it was in (usually that playerâs hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during
          each of their turns. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a
          main phase of their turn. See rule 305, âLands.â</p>

        <p>116.2b Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they
          have priority. See rule 707, âFace-Down Spells and Permanents.â</p>

        <p>116.2c Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time, usually to end a continuous effect or
          to stop a delayed triggered ability from triggering. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an
          action any time they have priority, unless that effect specifies another timing restriction, for as long as
          the effect allows it.</p>

        <p>116.2d Some effects from static abilities allow a player to take an action to ignore the effect from that
          ability for a duration. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have
          priority.</p>

        <p>116.2e One card (Circling Vultures) has the ability âYou may discard Circling Vultures any time you could
          cast an instant.â Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority.
        </p>

        <p>116.2f A player who has a card with suspend in their hand may exile that card. This is a special action. A
          player can take this action any time they have priority, but only if they could begin to cast that card by
          putting it onto the stack. See rule 702.61, âSuspend.â</p>

        <p>116.2g A player who has chosen a companion may pay {3} to put that card from outside the game into their
          hand. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is
          empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if they havenât done so yet this game. (See rule 702.138,
          âCompanion.â)</p>

        <p>116.2h In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die is a special action. A player can take this action any
          time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. Taking this action costs a
          player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn.
          Note that this number wonât be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if
          an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. See rule 901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>116.2i In a Conspiracy Draft game, turning a face-down conspiracy card in the command zone face up is a
          special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule 905.4a.</p>

        <p>116.3. If a player takes a special action, that player receives priority afterward.</p>

        <h2 id="117">
          117. Timing and Priority
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>117.1. Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action, which player can take actions at
          any given time is determined by a system of priority. The player with priority may cast spells, activate
          abilities, and take special actions.</p>

        <p>117.1a A player may cast an instant spell any time they have priority. A player may cast a noninstant spell
          during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty.</p>

        <p>117.1b A player may activate an activated ability any time they have priority.</p>

        <p>117.1c A player may take some special actions any time they have priority. A player may take other special
          actions during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty. See rule 116, âSpecial
          Actions.â</p>

        <p>117.1d A player may activate a mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or
          activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment (even
          in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability).</p>

        <p>117.2. Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or performed by the game rules, or
          are performed by players without receiving priority.</p>

        <p>117.2a Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a spell is being cast, an ability is
          being activated, or a spell or ability is resolving. (See rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â) However,
          nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers. Each time a player would receive priority, each
          ability that has triggered but hasnât yet been put on the stack is put on the stack. See rule 117.5.</p>

        <p>117.2b Static abilities continuously affect the game. Priority doesnât apply to them. (See rule 604,
          âHandling Static Abilities,â and rule 611, âContinuous Effects.â)</p>

        <p>117.2c Turn-based actions happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. Theyâre dealt with before
          a player would receive priority. See rule 117.3a. Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step
          and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule 703, âTurn-Based Actions.â</p>

        <p>117.2d State-based actions happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule 704. Theyâre dealt
          with before a player would receive priority. See rule 117.5.</p>

        <p>117.2e Resolving spells and abilities may instruct players to make choices or take actions, or may allow
          players to activate mana abilities. Even if a player is doing so, no player has priority while a spell or
          ability is resolving. See rule 608, âResolving Spells and Abilities.â</p>

        <p>117.3. Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:</p>

        <p>117.3a The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based
          actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule 703) have been dealt with and abilities that
          trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during
          the untap step. Players usually donât get priority during the cleanup step (see rule 514.3).</p>

        <p>117.3b The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other than a mana ability) resolves.</p>

        <p>117.3c If a player has priority when they cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action, that
          player receives priority afterward.</p>

        <p>117.3d If a player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that player passes. If any mana is in
          that playerâs mana pool, they announce what mana is there. Then the next player in turn order receives
          priority.</p>

        <p>117.4. If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between
          passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.
        </p>

        <p>117.5. Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a
          single event (see rule 704, âState-Based Actionsâ), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are
          performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack (see rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilitiesâ). These
          steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the
          player who would have received priority does so.</p>

        <p>117.6. In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, teams rather than individual players have
          priority. See rule 805, âShared Team Turns Option.â</p>

        <p>117.7. If a player with priority casts a spell or activates an activated ability while another spell or
          ability is already on the stack, the new spell or ability has been cast or activated âin response toâ the
          earlier spell or ability. The new spell or ability will resolve first. See rule 608, âResolving Spells and
          Abilities.â</p>

        <h2 id="118">
          118. Costs
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>118.1. A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking
          place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that
          contains that cost.</p>

        <p>118.2. If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities.
          Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>118.3. A player canât pay a cost without having the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a
          player with only 1 life canât pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent thatâs already tapped canât be tapped to
          pay a cost. See rule 202, âMana Cost and Color,â and rule 602, âActivating Activated Abilities.â</p>

        <p>118.3a Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a playerâs mana pool. (Players can always pay
          0 mana.) If excess mana remains in that playerâs mana pool after making that payment, the player announces
          what mana is still there.</p>

        <p>118.3b Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life from a playerâs life total. (Players
          can always pay 0 life.)</p>

        <p>118.3c Activating mana abilities is not mandatory, even if paying a cost is.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Lodestone Golem, which says âNonartifact spells cost {1} more to cast.â Another
          player removes the last time counter from a suspended sorcery card. That player must cast that spell if able,
          but doing so costs {1}. The player is forced to pay that cost if enough mana is in their mana pool, but the
          player isnât forced to activate a mana ability to produce that mana. If they donât, the card simply remains
          exiled.</p>

        <p>118.4. Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule 107.3.</p>

        <p>118.5. Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}. The action necessary for a player to pay
          such a cost is the playerâs acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no
          resources, itâs not automatically paid.</p>

        <p>118.5a A spell whose mana cost is {0} must still be cast the same way as one with a cost greater than zero;
          it wonât cast itself automatically. The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is {0}.</p>

        <p>118.6. Some objects have no mana cost. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an
          unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a
          spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an
          unpayable cost is an illegal action.</p>

        <p>118.6a If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional cost is imposed, the cost is still
          unpayable. If an alternative cost is applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to
          cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be paid.</p>

        <p>118.7. What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana
          component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, itâs considered to be {0}. Paying a cost
          changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.</p>

        <p>118.7a Effects that reduce a cost by an amount of generic mana affect only the generic mana component of that
          cost. They canât affect the colored or colorless mana components of that cost.</p>

        <p>118.7b If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored or colorless mana, but the cost doesnât require mana of
          that type, the cost is reduced by that amount of generic mana.</p>

        <p>118.7c If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color, the
          costâs mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the costâs generic mana component is reduced by
          the difference.</p>

        <p>118.7d If a cost is reduced by an amount of colorless mana that exceeds its colorless mana component, the
          costâs colorless mana component is reduced to nothing and the costâs generic mana component is reduced by the
          difference.</p>

        <p>118.7e If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that
          cost chooses one half of that symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see rule 601.2f). If a colored
          half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color. If a generic half is chosen, the cost is
          reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that halfâs number.</p>

        <p>118.7f If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol, the cost is reduced
          by one mana of that symbolâs color.</p>

        <p>118.7g If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols, the cost is
          reduced by that much generic mana.</p>

        <p>118.8. Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spellâs
          rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same
          time they pay the spellâs mana cost or the abilityâs activation cost. Note that some additional costs are
          listed in keywords; see rule 702.</p>

        <p>118.8a Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as itâs being cast or to an ability as itâs
          being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces their intentions to pay any or all of those
          costs as described in rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>118.8b Some additional costs are optional.</p>

        <p>118.8c If an effect instructs a player to cast a spell âif able,â and that spell has a mandatory additional
          cost that includes actions involving cards with a stated quality in a hidden zone, the player isnât required
          to cast that spell, even if those cards are present in that zone.</p>

        <p>118.8d Additional costs donât change a spellâs mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it.
          Spells and abilities that ask for that spellâs mana cost still see the original value.</p>

        <p>118.9. Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spellâs text, or applied
          to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spellâs mana cost. Alternative
          costs are usually phrased, âYou may [action] rather than pay [this objectâs] mana cost,â or âYou may cast
          [this object] without paying its mana cost.â Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule
          702.</p>

        <p>118.9a Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as itâs being cast. The controller of the
          spell announces their intentions to pay that cost as described in rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>118.9b Alternative costs are generally optional. An effect that allows you to cast a spell may require a
          certain alternative cost to be paid.</p>

        <p>118.9c An alternative cost doesnât change a spellâs mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast
          it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spellâs mana cost still see the original value.</p>

        <p>118.9d If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost
          reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost. (See rule 601.2f.)</p>

        <p>118.10. Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player canât
          sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require
          sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesnât pay another spell or
          abilityâs cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.</p>

        <p>118.11. The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the
          actions that are performed donât match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Psychic Vortex, an enchantment with a cumulative upkeep cost of âDraw a card,â and
          Obstinate Familiar, a creature that says âIf you would draw a card, you may skip that draw instead.â The
          player may decide to pay Psychic Vortexâs cumulative upkeep cost and then draw no cards instead of drawing the
          appropriate amount. The cumulative upkeep cost has still been paid.</p>

        <p>118.12. Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, â[Do something]. If [a player] [does,
          doesnât, or canât], [effect].â or â[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesnât, or canât],
          [effect].â The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The âIf [a player]
          [does, doesnât, or canât]â clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a
          mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.</p>
        <p>Example: You control Standstill, an enchantment that says âWhen a player casts a spell, sacrifice Standstill.
          If you do, each of that playerâs opponents draws three cards.â A spell is cast, causing Standstillâs ability
          to trigger. Then an ability is activated that exiles Standstill. When Standstillâs ability resolves, youâre
          unable to pay the âsacrifice Standstillâ cost. No player will draw cards.</p>
        <p>Example: Your opponent has cast Gather Specimens, a spell that says âIf a creature would enter the
          battlefield under an opponentâs control this turn, it enters the battlefield under your control instead.â You
          control a face-down Dermoplasm, a creature with morph that says âWhen Dermoplasm is turned face up, you may
          put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield face up. If you do, return Dermoplasm to
          its ownerâs hand.â You turn Dermoplasm face up, and you choose to put a creature card with morph from your
          hand onto the battlefield. Due to Gather Specimens, it enters the battlefield under your opponentâs control
          instead of yours. However, since you chose to pay the cost, Dermoplasm is still returned to its ownerâs hand.
        </p>

        <p>118.12a Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, â[Do something] unless [a player does
          something else].â This means the same thing as â[A player may do something else]. If [that player doesnât],
          [do something].â</p>

        <p>118.12b Some effects offer a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards
          found in that zone, followed by an âIf [a player] doesâ clause. This clause checks whether the player chose to
          search, not whether the player took any of the additional actions.</p>

        <p>118.13. Some costs contain mana symbols that can be paid in multiple ways. These include hybrid mana symbols
          and Phyrexian mana symbols.</p>

        <p>118.13a If the mana cost of a spell or the activation cost of an activated ability contains a mana symbol
          that can be paid in multiple ways, the choice of how to pay for that symbol is made as its controller proposes
          that spell or ability (see rule 601.2b).</p>

        <p>118.13b If a cost paid during the resolution of a spell or ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in
          multiple ways, the player paying that cost chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that
          cost.</p>

        <p>118.13c If the cost associated with a special action contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple
          ways, the player taking the special action chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that
          cost.</p>

        <h2 id="119">
          119. Life
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>119.1. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different
          starting life totals.</p>

        <p>119.1a In a Two-Headed Giant game, each teamâs starting life total is 30. See rule 810, âTwo-Headed Giant
          Variant.â</p>

        <p>119.1b In a Vanguard game, each playerâs starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their
          vanguard card. See rule 902, âVanguard.â</p>

        <p>119.1c In a Commander game, each playerâs starting life total is 40. See rule 903, âCommander.â</p>

        <p>119.1d. In a two-player Brawl game, each playerâs starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game,
          each playerâs starting life total is 30. See rule 903.12, âBrawl Option.â</p>

        <p>119.1e In an Archenemy game, the archenemyâs starting life total is 40. See rule 904, âArchenemy.â</p>

        <p>119.2. Damage dealt to a player normally causes that player to lose that much life. See rule 120.3.</p>

        <p>119.3. If an effect causes a player to gain life or lose life, that playerâs life total is adjusted
          accordingly.</p>

        <p>119.4. If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, the player may do so only
          if their life total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays life, the payment
          is subtracted from their life total; in other words, the player loses that much life. (Players can always pay
          0 life.)</p>

        <p>119.4a If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0 in a Two-Headed Giant
          game, the player may do so only if their teamâs life total is greater than or equal to the total amount of
          life both team members are paying for that cost or effect. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted
          from their teamâs life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)</p>

        <p>119.5. If an effect sets a playerâs life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary
          amount of life to end up with the new total.</p>

        <p>119.6. If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>119.7. If an effect says that a player canât gain life, that player canât make an exchange such that the
          playerâs life total would become higher; in that case, the exchange wonât happen. Similarly, if an effect
          redistributes life totals, a player canât receive a new life total such that the playerâs life total would
          become higher. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life canât be paid, and a replacement
          effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player wonât do anything.</p>

        <p>119.8. If an effect says that a player canât lose life, that player canât make an exchange such that the
          playerâs life total would become lower; in that case, the exchange wonât happen. Similarly, if an effect
          redistributes life totals, a player canât receive a new life total such that the playerâs life total would
          become lower. In addition, a cost that involves having that player pay life canât be paid.</p>

        <p>119.9. Some triggered abilities are written, âWhenever [a player] gains life, . . . .â Such abilities are
          treated as though they are written, âWhenever a source causes [a player] to gain life, . . . .â If a player
          gains 0 life, no life gain event has occurred, and these abilities wonât trigger.</p>

        <p>119.10. Some replacement effects are written, âIf [a player] would gain life, . . . .â Such abilities are
          treated as though they are written, âIf a source would cause [a player] to gain life, . . . .â If a player
          gains 0 life, no life gain event would occur, and these effects wonât apply.</p>

        <h2 id="120">
          120. Damage
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>120.1. Objects can deal damage to creatures, planeswalkers, and players. This is generally detrimental to the
          object or player that receives that damage. An object that deals damage is the source of that damage.</p>

        <p>120.1a Damage canât be dealt to an object thatâs neither a creature nor a planeswalker.</p>

        <p>120.2. Any object can deal damage.</p>

        <p>120.2a Damage may be dealt as a result of combat. Each attacking and blocking creature deals combat damage
          equal to its power during the combat damage step.</p>

        <p>120.2b Damage may be dealt as an effect of a spell or ability. The spell or ability will specify which object
          deals that damage.</p>

        <p>120.3. Damage may have one or more of the following results, depending on whether the recipient of the damage
          is a player or permanent, the characteristics of the damageâs source, and the characteristics of the damageâs
          recipient (if itâs a permanent).</p>

        <p>120.3a Damage dealt to a player by a source without infect causes that player to lose that much life.</p>

        <p>120.3b Damage dealt to a player by a source with infect causes that sourceâs controller to give the player
          that many poison counters.</p>

        <p>120.3c Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from that planeswalker.
        </p>

        <p>120.3d Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither and/or infect causes that sourceâs controller to
          put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature.</p>

        <p>120.3e Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect causes that much damage to be
          marked on that creature.</p>

        <p>120.3f Damage dealt by a source with lifelink causes that sourceâs controller to gain that much life, in
          addition to the damageâs other results.</p>

        <p>120.4. Damage is processed in a four-part sequence.</p>

        <p>120.4a First, if an effect is causing damage to be dealt to a creature and that effect specifies that excess
          damage is dealt to another object or player instead, the damage event is modified to deal damage accordingly.
          Excess damage is damage greater than lethal damage that would be dealt to a creature. Lethal damage is the
          creatureâs toughness minus damage marked on that creature and other damage being dealt to it at the same time
          as this damage. Any damage greater than 1 is excess damage if the source dealing that damage has deathtouch.
        </p>

        <p>120.4b Second, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention effects that interact with damage.
          (See rule 614, âReplacement Effects,â and rule 615, âPrevention Effects.â) Abilities that trigger when damage
          is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack.</p>

        <p>120.4c Third, damage thatâs been dealt is processed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that
          interact with those results (such as life loss or counters).</p>

        <p>120.4d Finally, the damage event occurs.</p>
        <p>Example: A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says âIf you would gain life, you gain
          twice that much life instead,â attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. Itâs blocked by a 2/2
          creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the
          blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to
          the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2
          creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. Thatâs processed into its results, so the damage event is
          now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the
          3/3 creature]. Boon Reflectionâs effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on
          the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage
          event occurs.</p>
        <p>Example: The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says âIf you control a
          creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.â That player is at
          2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says âThe
          next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage
          prevented this way,â targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the
          defending player]. Awe Strikeâs effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the
          defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. Thatâs processed into its results, so the damage event
          is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worshipâs effect sees that the
          damage event would not reduce the playerâs life total to less than 1, so Worshipâs effect is not applied. Then
          the damage event occurs.</p>

        <p>120.5. Damage dealt to a creature or planeswalker doesnât destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage
          doesnât destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or planeswalker, or otherwise put it
          into its ownerâs graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule 704.</p>
        <p>Example: A player casts Lightning Bolt, an instant that says âLightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target,â
          targeting a 2/2 creature. After Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to that creature, the creature is destroyed as a
          state-based action. Neither Lightning Bolt nor the damage dealt by Lightning Bolt destroyed that creature.</p>

        <p>120.6. Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a
          creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature
          has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage marked on a
          permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.15, âRegenerateâ) and during the cleanup step (see rule
          514.2).</p>

        <p>120.7. The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of
          damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred
          to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement effect thatâs waiting to apply, or by a delayed
          triggered ability thatâs waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in);
          or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesnât need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal
          choice. See rule 609.7, âSources of Damage.â</p>

        <p>120.8. If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on
          damage being dealt wonât trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt
          by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to
          replace, so they have no effect.</p>

        <p>120.9. If an ability triggers on damage being dealt by a specific source or sources, and the effect refers to
          the âdamage dealt,â it refers only to the damage dealt by the specified sources and not to any damage dealt at
          the same time by other sources.</p>

          121. Drawing a Card
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>121.1. A player draws a card by putting the top card of their library into their hand. This is done as a
          turn-based action during each playerâs draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell
          or ability.</p>

        <p>121.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player
          performs that many individual card draws.</p>

        <p>121.2a An instruction to draw multiple cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number
          of cards drawn. This modification occurs before considering any of the individual card draws. See rule 616.1f.
        </p>

        <p>121.2b Some effects say that a player canât draw more than one card each turn. Such an effect applies to
          individual card draws. Instructions to draw multiple cards may still be partially carried out. However, if an
          effect offers the player a choice to draw multiple cards, the affected player canât choose to do so.
          Similarly, the player canât pay a cost that includes drawing multiple cards.</p>

        <p>121.2c If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards, the active player performs all of their
          draws first, then each other player in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>121.2d If a rule or effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a game thatâs using the shared
          team turns option (such as a Two-Headed Giant game), first each player on the active team, in whatever order
          that team likes, performs their draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.
        </p>

        <p>121.3. If there are no cards in a playerâs library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a
          card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player canât draw cards and another
          effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player canât choose to do so.</p>

        <p>121.3a The same principles apply if the player whoâs making the choice is not the player who would draw the
          card. If the latter player has no cards in their library, the choice can be taken. If an effect says that the
          latter player canât draw a card, the choice canât be taken.</p>

        <p>121.4. A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game the next time a
          player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>121.5. If an effect moves cards from a playerâs library to that playerâs hand without using the word âdraw,â
          the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and
          effects that replace card draws, as well as if the playerâs library is empty.</p>

        <p>121.6. Some effects replace card draws.</p>

        <p>121.6a An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no
          cards in the affected playerâs library.</p>

        <p>121.6b If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed
          before resuming the sequence.</p>

        <p>121.6c Some effects perform additional actions on a card after itâs drawn. If the draw is replaced, the
          additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any
          subsequent replacement effects.</p>

        <p>121.7. Some replacement effects and prevention effects result in one or more card draws. In such a case, if
          there are any parts of the original event that havenât been replaced, those parts occur first, then the card
          draws happen one at a time.</p>

        <p>121.8. If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell is being cast, the drawn card is
          kept face down until that spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i) or until the casting process is reversed (see
          rule 723, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). While face down, itâs considered to have no characteristics. The same
          is true with relation to another ability being activated. If an effect allows or instructs a player to reveal
          the card as itâs being drawn, itâs revealed after the spell becomes cast or the ability becomes activated.</p>

        <p>121.9. If an effect gives a player the option to reveal a card as they draw it, that player may look at that
          card as they draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.</p>

        <h2 id="122">
          122. Counters
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>122.1. A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts
          with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. Notably, a counter is
          not a token, and a token is not a counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.</p>

        <p>122.1a A +X/+Y counter on a creature or on a creature card in a zone other than the battlefield, where X and
          Y are numbers, adds X to that objectâs power and Y to that objectâs toughness. Similarly, -X/-Y counters
          subtract from power and toughness. See rule 613.4c.</p>

        <p>122.1b A keyword counter on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object
          to gain that keyword. The keywords that a keyword counter can be are flying, first strike, double strike,
          deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, trample, and vigilance, as well as any
          variants of those keywords. See rule 613.1f.</p>

        <p>122.1c The number of loyalty counters on a planeswalker on the battlefield indicates how much loyalty it has.
          A planeswalker with 0 loyalty is put into its ownerâs graveyard as a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>122.1d If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See
          rule 704. A player is âpoisonedâ if they have one or more poison counters. (See rule 810 for additional rules
          for Two-Headed Giant games.)</p>

        <p>122.2. Counters on an object are not retained if that object moves from one zone to another. The counters are
          not âremovedâ; they simply cease to exist. See rule 400.7.</p>

        <p>122.3. If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are
          removed from it as a state-based action, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on
          it. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>122.4. If a permanent with an ability that says it canât have more than N counters of a certain kind on it
          has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it as a state-based
          action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>122.5. If an effect says to âmoveâ a counter, it means to remove that counter from the object itâs currently
          on and put it onto a second object. If either of these actions isnât possible, itâs not possible to move a
          counter, and no counter is removed from or put onto anything. This may occur if the first and second objects
          are the same object; if the first object doesnât have the appropriate kind of counter on it; if the second
          object canât have counters put onto it; or if either object is no longer in the correct zone.</p>

        <p>122.6. Some spells and abilities refer to counters being put on an object. This refers to putting counters on
          that object while itâs on the battlefield and also to an object thatâs given counters as it enters the
          battlefield.</p>

        <p>122.6a If an object enters the battlefield with counters on it, the effect causing the object to be given
          counters may specify which player puts those counters on it. If the effect doesnât specify a player, the
          objectâs controller puts those counters on it.</p>

        <p>122.7. An ability that triggers âWhen/Whenever the Nth [kind] counterâ is put on an object triggers when one
          or more counters of the appropriate kind are put on the object such that the object had fewer than N counters
          on it before the counters were put on it and N or more counters on it after.</p>

        <p>122.8. If a triggered ability instructs a player to âput those countersâ or to âput [an objectâs] countersâ
          on another object and that abilityâs trigger condition or effect checks that the object with those counters
          left the battlefield, that player puts a number of counters on the second object of each kind the first object
          had before it left the battlefield. The player doesnât move counters from one object to another.</p>

        <p>200.1. The parts of a card are name, mana cost, illustration, color indicator, type line, expansion symbol,
          text box, power and toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, life modifier, illustration credit, legal text, and
          collector number. Some cards may have more than one of any or all of these parts.</p>

        <p>200.2. Some parts of a card are also characteristics of the object that has them. See rule 109.3.</p>

        <p>200.3. Some objects that arenât cards (tokens, copies of cards, and copies of spells) have some of the parts
          of a card, but only the ones that are also characteristics. See rule 111 and rule 706.</p>

        <h2 id="201">
          201. Name
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>201.1. The name of a card is printed on its upper left corner.</p>

        <p>201.2. A cardâs name is always considered to be the English version of its name, regardless of printed
          language.</p>

        <p>201.2a Two objects have the same name if their names are identical.</p>

        <p>201.2b If an object has more than one name, it has the same name as another object if there are one or more
          names that both objects have in common.</p>

        <p>201.2c Two or more objects have different names if there are no names that both objects have in common.</p>

        <p>201.3. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player must choose the name of a card in
          the Oracle card reference. (See rule 108.1.) A player may not choose the name of a token unless itâs also the
          name of a card.</p>

        <p>201.3a If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, the player must choose
          the name of a card whose Oracle text matches those characteristics. (See rule 108.1.)</p>
        <p>Example: Dispossess reads, in part, âChoose an artifact card name.â The player can choose the name of any
          artifact card, even one thatâs not legal in the format of the current game. The player canât choose Island,
          even if an Island on the battlefield has been turned into artifact by some effect.</p>

        <p>201.3b If a player wants to choose the name of a split card, the player must choose the name of one of its
          halves, but not both. (See rule 708.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain
          characteristics, use only that halfâs characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3c If a player wants to choose a flip cardâs alternative name, the player may do so. (See rule 709.) If a
          player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use the cardâs characteristics as
          modified by its alternative characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3d If a player wants to choose the name of the back face of a double-faced card, the player may do so.
          (See rule 711.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use only the
          characteristics of the back face to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3e If a player wants to choose the name of the combined back face of a meld pair, the player may do so.
          (See rule 712.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use only the
          characteristics of the combined back face to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.3f If a player wants to choose an adventurer cardâs alternative name, the player may do so. (See rule
          715.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use the cardâs
          characteristics as modified by its alternative characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.</p>

        <p>201.4. Text that refers to the object itâs on by name means just that particular object and not any other
          objects with that name, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects.</p>

        <p>201.4a If an abilityâs effect grants another ability to an object, and that second ability refers to that
          first abilityâs source by name, the name refers only to the specific object that is that first abilityâs
          source, not to any other object with the same name. This is also true if the second ability is copied onto a
          new object.</p>
        <p>Example: Gutter Grime has an ability that reads âWhenever a nontoken creature you control dies, put a slime
          counter on Gutter Grime, then create a green Ooze creature token with âThis creatureâs power and toughness are
          each equal to the number of slime counters on Gutter Grime.ââ The ability granted to the token only looks at
          the Gutter Grime that created the token, not at any other Gutter Grime on the battlefield. A copy of that
          token would also have an ability that referred only to the Gutter Grime that created the original token.</p>

        <p>201.4b If an ability of an object refers to that object by name, and an object with a different name gains
          that ability, each instance of the first name in the gained ability that refers to the first object by name
          should be treated as the second name.</p>
        <p>Example: Quicksilver Elemental says, in part, â{U}: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of
          target creature until end of turn.â If it gains an ability that says â{G}: Regenerate Cudgel Troll,â
          activating that ability will regenerate Quicksilver Elemental, not the Cudgel Troll it gained the ability
          from.</p>
        <p>Example: Glacial Ray is an instant with splice onto Arcane that says âGlacial Ray deals 2 damage to any
          target.â If itâs spliced onto a Kodamaâs Reach, that Kodamaâs Reach deals 2 damage to the target.</p>
        <p>Example: Dimir Doppelganger says â{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger
          becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.â Dimir Doppelgangerâs ability is activated targeting a
          Runeclaw Bear card. The Doppelganger becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear and gains an ability that should be
          treated as saying â{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Runeclaw Bear becomes a copy of
          that card and gains this ability.â</p>

        <p>201.4c Text printed on some legendary cards refers to that card by a shortened version of its name. Instances
          of a cardâs shortened name used in this manner are treated as though they used the cardâs full name.</p>

        <p>201.5. Some promotional versions of Ikoriaâ¢: Lair of Behemoths cards feature a name other than their own in
          the upper left corner, with their normal name in a secondary title bar below it. These cards have only the
          card name specified in the secondary title bar, not the name printed where a cardâs name would normally
          appear.</p>

        <h2 id="202">
          202. Mana Cost and Color
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>202.1. A cardâs mana cost is indicated by mana symbols near the top of the card. (See rule 107.4.) On most
          cards, these symbols are printed in the upper right corner. Some cards from the Future Sight set have
          alternate frames in which the mana symbols appear to the left of the illustration.</p>

        <p>202.1a The mana cost of an object represents what a player must spend from their mana pool to cast that card.
          Unless an objectâs mana cost includes Phyrexian mana symbols (see rule 107.4f), paying that mana cost requires
          matching the type of any colored or colorless mana symbols as well as paying the generic mana indicated in the
          cost.</p>

        <p>202.1b Some objects have no mana cost. This normally includes all land cards, any other cards that have no
          mana symbols where their mana cost would appear, tokens (unless the effect that creates them specifies
          otherwise), and nontraditional Magic cards. Having no mana cost represents an unpayable cost (see rule 118.6).
          Note that lands are played without paying any costs (see rule 305, âLandsâ).</p>

        <p>202.2. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its
          frame.</p>

        <p>202.2a The five colors are white, blue, black, red, and green. The white mana symbol is represented by {W},
          blue by {U}, black by {B}, red by {R}, and green by {G}.</p>
        <p>Example: An object with a mana cost of {2}{W} is white, an object with a mana cost of {2} is colorless, and
          one with a mana cost of {2}{W}{B} is both white and black.</p>

        <p>202.2b Objects with no colored mana symbols in their mana costs are colorless.</p>

        <p>202.2c An object with two or more different colored mana symbols in its mana cost is each of the colors of
          those mana symbols. Most multicolored cards are printed with a gold frame, but this is not a requirement for a
          card to be multicolored.</p>

        <p>202.2d An object with one or more hybrid mana symbols and/or Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is all
          of the colors of those mana symbols, in addition to any other colors the object might be. (Most cards with
          hybrid mana symbols in their mana costs are printed in a two-tone frame. See rule 107.4e.)</p>

        <p>202.2e An object may have a color indicator printed to the left of the type line. That object is each color
          denoted by that color indicator. (See rule 204.)</p>

        <p>202.2f Effects may change an objectâs color, give a color to a colorless object, or make a colored object
          become colorless; see rule 105.3.</p>

        <p>202.3. The converted mana cost of an object is a number equal to the total amount of mana in its mana cost,
          regardless of color.</p>
        <p>Example: A mana cost of {3}{U}{U} translates to a converted mana cost of 5.</p>

        <p>202.3a The converted mana cost of an object with no mana cost is 0, unless that object is the back face of a
          transforming double-faced permanent or is a melded permanent.</p>

        <p>202.3b The converted mana cost of a transforming double-faced permanentâs back face is calculated as though
          it had the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent is a copy of the back face of a transforming
          double-faced card (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the converted mana
          cost of that permanent is 0.</p>
        <p>Example: Huntmaster of the Fells is a transforming double-faced card with mana cost {2}{R}{G}. Its converted
          mana cost is 4. After it transforms to its other face (Ravager of the Fells), its converted mana cost remains
          4.</p>
        <p>Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its converted mana cost is 0.</p>
        <p>Example: Insectile Aberration is the back face of a transforming double-faced card whose front face has mana
          cost {U}. It becomes a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its converted mana cost becomes 0.</p>

        <p>202.3c The converted mana cost of a melded permanent is calculated as though it had the combined mana cost of
          the front faces of each card that represents it. If a permanent is a copy of a melded permanent (even if that
          copy is represented by two other meld cards), the converted mana cost of the copy is 0.</p>

        <p>202.3d The converted mana cost of a split card not on the stack or of a fused split spell on the stack is
          determined from the combined mana costs of its halves. Otherwise, while a split card is on the stack, the
          converted mana cost of the spell is determined by the mana cost of the half that was chosen to be cast. See
          rule 708, âSplit Cards.â</p>

        <p>202.3e When calculating the converted mana cost of an object with an {X} in its mana cost, X is treated as 0
          while the object is not on the stack, and X is treated as the number chosen for it while the object is on the
          stack.</p>

        <p>202.3f When calculating the converted mana cost of an object with a hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost, use
          the largest component of each hybrid symbol.</p>
        <p>Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {1}{W/U}{W/U} is 3.</p>
        <p>Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {2/B}{2/B}{2/B} is 6.</p>

        <p>202.3g Each Phyrexian mana symbol in a cardâs mana cost contributes 1 to its converted mana cost.</p>
        <p>Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {1}{W/P}{W/P} is 3.</p>

        <p>202.4. Any additional cost listed in an objectâs rules text or imposed by an effect isnât part of the mana
          cost. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â) Such costs are paid at the same time as the spellâs other costs.</p>

          203. Illustration
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>203.1. The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no effect on game play. For example, a
          creature doesnât have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if itâs depicted as flying.</p>

        <h2 id="204">
          204. Color Indicator
        </h2>
<hr>

        <p>204.1. The color indicator is printed to the left of the type line directly below the illustration. It
          consists of a circular symbol filled in with one or more colors. A color indicator is usually found on nonland
          cards without a mana cost.</p>

        <p>204.2. An object with a color indicator is each color denoted by that color indicator.</p>

        <h2 id="205">
          205. Type Line
        </h2>

        <p>205.1. The type line is printed directly below the illustration. It contains the cardâs card type(s). It also
          contains the cardâs subtype(s) and supertype(s), if applicable.</p>

        <p>205.1a Some effects set an objectâs card type. In such cases, the new card type(s) replaces any existing card
          types. Counters, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the
          new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an objectâs subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces
          any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types,
          planeswalker types, or spell types). If an objectâs card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that
          card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they
          are also removed for the entire time the objectâs card type is removed. Removing an objectâs subtype doesnât
          affect its card types at all.</p>

        <p>205.1b Some effects change an objectâs card type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a
          prior card type, supertype, or subtype. In such cases, all the objectâs prior card types, supertypes, and
          subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use the phrase âin addition to its typesâ or that
          state that something is âstill a [type, supertype, or subtype].â Some effects state that an object becomes an
          âartifact creatureâ; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes.
          Some effects state that an object becomes a â[creature type or types] artifact creatureâ; these effects also
          allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes other than creature types, but replace any
          existing creature types.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads, âAll lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.â The affected lands now have
          two card types: creature and land. If there were any lands that were also artifacts before the abilityâs
          effect applied to them, those lands would become âartifact land creatures,â not just âcreatures,â or âland
          creatures.â The effect allows them to retain both the artifact and land card types. In addition, each land
          affected by the ability retains any land types and supertypes it had before the ability took effect.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads, âAll artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures.â If a permanent is both an artifact and
          an enchantment, it will become an artifact enchantment creature.</p>

        <h2>
          <p>205.2. Card Types</p>


        <p>205.2a The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane,
          planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard. See section 3, âCard Types.â</p>

        <p>205.2b Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects satisfy
          the criteria for any effect that applies to any of their card types.</p>

        <p>205.2c Tokens have card types even though they arenât cards. The same is true of copies of spells and copies
          of cards.</p>

        <p>205.3. Subtypes</p>

        <p>205.3a A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line.</p>

        <p>205.3b Subtypes of each card type except plane are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each
          word after the dash is a separate subtype; such objects may have multiple types. Subtypes of planes are also
          listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single
          subtype.</p>
        <p>Example: âBasic Land â Mountainâ means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain. âCreature â Goblin
          Wizardâ means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard. âArtifact â Equipmentâ means the
          card is an artifact with the subtype Equipment.</p>

        <p>205.3c If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its
          appropriate card type.</p>
        <p>Example: Dryad Arborâs type line says âLand Creature â Forest Dryad.â Forest is a land type, and Dryad is a
          creature type.</p>

        <p>205.3d An object canât gain a subtype that doesnât correspond to one of that objectâs types.</p>

        <p>205.3e If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one,
          existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player canât choose
          a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type.</p>
        <p>Example: When choosing a creature type, âMerfolkâ or âWizardâ is acceptable, but âMerfolk Wizardâ is not.
          Words like âartifact,â âopponent,â âSwamp,â or âtruckâ canât be chosen because they arenât creature types.</p>

        <p>205.3f Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete. Many cards have retroactively received
          subtypes. Use the Oracle card reference to determine what a cardâs subtypes are. (See rule 108.1.)</p>

        <p>205.3g Artifacts have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called artifact types. The
          artifact types are Clue, Contraption, Equipment (see rule 301.5), Food, Fortification (see rule 301.6), Gold,
          Treasure, and Vehicle (see rule 301.7).</p>

        <p>205.3h Enchantments have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called enchantment types. The
          enchantment types are Aura (see rule 303.4), Cartouche, Curse, Saga (see rule 714), and Shrine.</p>

        <p>205.3i Lands have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called land types. The land types are
          Desert, Forest, Gate, Island, Lair, Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Power-Plant, Swamp, Tower, and Urzaâs.</p>
        <p>Of that list, Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp are the basic land types. See rule 305.6.</p>

        <p>205.3j Planeswalkers have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planeswalker types. The
          planeswalker types are Ajani, Aminatou, Angrath, Arlinn, Ashiok, Basri, Bolas, Calix, Chandra, Dack, Daretti,
          Davriel, Domri, Dovin, Elspeth, Estrid, Freyalise, Garruk, Gideon, Huatli, Jace, Jaya, Karn, Kasmina, Kaya,

          Yanggu, and Yanling.</p>

        <p>205.3k Instants and sorceries share their lists of subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. The spell
          types are Adventure, Arcane, and Trap.</p>

          <br>

        <p>205.3n Planes have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are called planar types. The planar types
          are Alara, Arkhos, Azgol, Belenon, Bolasâs Meditation Realm, Dominaria, Equilor, Ergamon, Fabacin, Innistrad,
          Iquatana, Ir, Kaldheim, Kamigawa, Karsus, Kephalai, Kinshala, Kolbahan, Kyneth, Lorwyn, Luvion, Mercadia,

          Serraâs Realm, Shadowmoor, Shandalar, Ulgrotha, Valla, Vryn, Wildfire, Xerex, and Zendikar.</p>

        <p>205.3p Phenomenon cards, scheme cards, vanguard cards, and conspiracy cards have no subtypes.</p>

        <p>205.4. Supertypes</p>

        <p>205.4a A card can also have one or more supertypes. These are printed directly before its card types. The
          supertypes are basic, legendary, ongoing, snow, and world.</p>

        <p>205.4b An objectâs supertype is independent of its card type and subtype, even though some supertypes are
          closely identified with specific card types. Changing an objectâs card types or subtypes wonât change its
          supertypes. Changing an objectâs supertypes wonât change its card types or subtypes. When an object gains or
          loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads, âAll lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.â If any of the affected lands
          were legendary, they are still legendary.</p>

        <p>205.4c Any land with the supertype âbasicâ is a basic land. Any land that doesnât have this supertype is a
          nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.</p>
        <p>Cards printed in sets prior to the Eighth Edition core set didnât use the word âbasicâ to indicate a basic
          land. Cards from those sets with the following names are basic lands and have received errata in the Oracle
          card reference accordingly: Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, Swamp, Snow-Covered Forest, Snow-Covered Island,
          Snow-Covered Mountain, Snow-Covered Plains, and Snow-Covered Swamp.</p>

        <p>205.4d Any permanent with the supertype âlegendaryâ is subject to the state-based action for legendary
          permanents, also called the âlegend ruleâ (see rule 704.5j).</p>

        <p>205.4e Any instant or sorcery spell with the supertype âlegendaryâ is subject to a casting restriction. A
          player canât cast a legendary instant or sorcery spell unless that player controls a legendary creature or a
          legendary planeswalker.</p>

        <p>205.4f Any permanent with the supertype âworldâ is subject to the state-based action for world permanents,
          also called the âworld ruleâ (see rule 704.5k).</p>

        <p>205.4g Any permanent with the supertype âsnowâ is a snow permanent. Any permanent that doesnât have this
          supertype is a nonsnow permanent, regardless of its name.</p>

        <p>205.4h Any scheme card with the supertype âongoingâ is exempt from the state-based action for schemes (see
          rule 704.6e).</p>

          206. Expansion Symbol
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>206.1. The expansion symbol indicates which Magic set a card is from. Itâs a small icon normally printed
          below the right edge of the illustration. It has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>206.2. The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card within its set. A red-orange symbol
          indicates the card is mythic rare. A gold symbol indicates the card is rare. A silver symbol indicates the
          card is uncommon. A black or white symbol indicates the card is common or is a basic land. A purple symbol
          signifies a special rarity; to date, only the Time SpiralÂ® âtimeshiftedâ cards, which were rarer than that
          setâs rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the Exodusâ¢ set, all expansion symbols were
          black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified
          Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didnât have expansion symbols at all.)</p>

        <p>206.3. Previously, a spell or ability that affected cards from a particular set checked for that setâs
          expansion symbol. These cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to say they affect cards âwith

        <h2 id="207">
          207. Text Box
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>207.1. The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the
          cardâs abilities.</p>

        <p>207.2. The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function.</p>

        <p>207.2a Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes a rule that applies to that card.
          It usually appears on the same line as the ability itâs relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it
          applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability.</p>

        <p>207.2b Flavor text is italicized text that, like the illustration, adds artistic appeal to the game. It
          appears below the rules text.</p>

        <p>207.2c An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Ability words are similar to
          keywords in that they tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no special rules
          meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive Rules. The ability words are adamant, addendum,
          battalion, bloodrush, channel, chroma, cohort, constellation, converge, councilâs dilemma, delirium, domain,
          eminence, enrage, fateful hour, ferocious, formidable, grandeur, hellbent, heroic, imprint, inspired, join
          forces, kinship, landfall, lieutenant, metalcraft, morbid, parley, radiance, raid, rally, revolt, spell
          mastery, strive, sweep, tempting offer, threshold, undergrowth, and will of the council.</p>

        <p>207.3. Some cards have decorative icons in the background of their text boxes. For example, a guild icon
          appears in the text box of many cards associated with the guilds of Ravnica, and a faction icon appears in the
          text box of most Scars of Mirrodinâ¢ block cards. Similarly, many promotional cards include decorative icons.
          These icons have no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>207.4. The chaos symbol {CHAOS} appears in the text box of each plane card to the left of a triggered ability
          that triggers whenever {CHAOS} is rolled on the planar die. The symbol itself has no special rules meaning.
        </p>

        <h2 id="208">
          208. Power/Toughness
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>208.1. A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its lower right corner. The first
          number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of
          damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and
          toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.</p>

        <p>208.2. Rather than a fixed number, some creature cards have power and/or toughness that includes a star (*).
        </p>

        <p>208.2a The card may have a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness according to
          some stated condition. (See rule 604.3.) Such an ability is worded â[This creatureâs] [power or toughness] is
          equal to . . .â or â[This creatureâs] power and toughness are each equal to . . .â This ability functions
          everywhere, even outside the game. If the ability needs to use a number that canât be determined, including
          inside a calculation, use 0 instead of that number.</p>
        <p>Example: Lost Order of Jarkeld has power and toughness each equal to 1+*. It has the abilities âAs Lost Order
          of Jarkeld enters the battlefield, choose an opponentâ and âLost Order of Jarkeldâs power and toughness are
          each equal to 1 plus the number of creatures the chosen player controls.â While Lost Order of Jarkeld isnât on
          the battlefield, there wonât be a chosen player. Its power and toughness will each be equal to 1 plus 0, so
          itâs 1/1.</p>

        <p>208.2b The card may have a static ability that creates a replacement effect that sets the creatureâs power
          and toughness to one of a number of specific values as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up. (See
          rule 614, âReplacement Effects.â) Such an ability is worded âAs [this creature] enters the battlefield . . .
          ,â âAs [this creature] is turned face up . . . ,â or â[This creature] enters the battlefield as . . .â and
          lists two or more specific power and toughness values (and may also list additional characteristics). The
          characteristics chosen or determined with these effects affect the creatureâs copiable values. (See rule
          706.2.) While the card isnât on the battlefield, its power and toughness are each considered to be 0.</p>

        <p>208.3. A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if itâs a card with a power and toughness
          printed on it (such as a Vehicle). A noncreature object not on the battlefield has power or toughness only if
          it has a power and toughness printed on it.</p>

        <p>208.3a If an effect would be created that affects the power and/or toughness of a noncreature permanent, that
          effect is created even though it doesnât do anything unless that permanent becomes a creature.</p>
        <p>Example: Veteran Motorist has the ability âWhenever Veteran Motorist crews a Vehicle, that Vehicle gets +1/+1
          until end of turn,â and itâs tapped to pay the crew cost of a Vehicle. This triggered ability resolves while
          the Vehicle it crewed isnât yet a creature. The continuous effect is created and will apply to the Vehicle
          once it becomes a creature.</p>

        <p>208.4. Effects that set a creatureâs power and/or toughness to specific values may refer to that creatureâs
          âbase power,â âbase toughness,â or âbase power and toughness.â Other continuous effects may further modify the
          creatureâs power and toughness. See rule 613, âInteraction of Continuous Effects.â</p>

        <p>208.5. If a creature somehow has no value for its power, its power is 0. The same is true for toughness.</p>

        <h2 id="209">
          209. Loyalty
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>209.1. Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its
          loyalty while itâs not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the battlefield
          with that many loyalty counters on it.</p>

        <p>209.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow
          special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority
          and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanentâs loyalty
          abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, âLoyalty Abilities.â</p>

        <h2 id="210">
          210. Hand Modifier
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>210.1. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by
          a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting hand size
          and the maximum hand size of the vanguard cardâs owner are determined. See rule 103.4.</p>

        <h2 id="211">
          211. Life Modifier
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>211.1. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by
          a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total
          of the vanguard cardâs owner is determined. See rule 103.3.</p>

        <h2 id="212">
          212. Information Below the Text Box
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>212.1. Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. Not all card sets
          were printed with all of the information listed below on each card.</p>

        <p>212.1a Most card sets feature collector numbers. This information is printed in the form [card number]/[total
          cards in the set] or simply [card number]. Some cards, such as unique cards in Planeswalker Decks, have card
          numbers that exceed the listed total number of cards.</p>

        <p>212.1b A cardâs rarity is indicated with a single letter following the collector number.</p>

        <p>212.1c Some promotional cards include information to indicate the specific promotion the card is associated
          with.</p>

        <p>212.1d The three-character code representing the set in which a card is printed and the two-character code
          representing the language in which a card is printed are separated by a bullet point. If a card is premium,
          these codes are instead separated by a star.</p>

        <p>212.1e The illustration credit for a card follows the paintbrush icon or, on older cards, the abbreviation
          âIllus.â</p>

        <p>212.1f Legal text (the fine print at the bottom or bottom-right of the card) lists the trademark and
          copyright information.</p>

          3. Card Types</header>
        </h1>

        <h2 id="300">
          300. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>300.1. The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane,
          planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard.</p>

        <p>300.2. Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects combine
          the aspects of each of those card types, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or all of
          those card types.</p>

        <p>300.2a An object thatâs both a land and another card type (for example, an artifact land) can only be played
          as a land. It canât be cast as a spell.</p>

        <p>300.2b Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal card follow the rules for
          casting and resolving a card of the other card type.</p>

        <h2 id="301">
          301. Artifacts
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>301.1. A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from their hand during a main phase of their turn
          when the stack is empty. Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â)</p>

        <p>301.2. When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>

        <p>301.3. Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âArtifact â Equipment.â
          Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Artifacts may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3g for
          the complete list of artifact types.</p>

        <p>301.4. Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type. Most artifacts have no colored mana
          symbols in their mana costs, and are therefore colorless. However, there is no correlation between being
          colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless objects may be card types other than
          artifact.</p>

        <p>301.5. Some artifacts have the subtype âEquipment.â An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It canât
          legally be attached to anything that isnât a creature.</p>

        <p>301.5a The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the âequipped creature.â The Equipment is attached
          to, or âequips,â that creature.</p>

        <p>301.5b An Equipment is cast and enters the battlefield just like any other artifact. An Equipment doesnât
          enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature
          you control (see rule 702.6, âEquipâ). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is
          activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an
          effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that canât be equipped by it, the Equipment doesnât move.
        </p>

        <p>301.5c An Equipment thatâs also a creature canât equip a creature. An Equipment that loses the subtype
          âEquipmentâ canât equip a creature. An Equipment canât equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or
          nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a
          state-based action. See rule 704.) An Equipment canât equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability
          would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipmentâs controller chooses which creature it
          equips.</p>

        <p>301.5d An Equipmentâs controller is separate from the equipped creatureâs controller; the two need not be the
          same. Changing control of the creature doesnât change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the
          Equipmentâs controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped
          creature (with âgainsâ or âhasâ), the equipped creatureâs controller is the only one who can activate that
          ability.</p>

        <p>301.5e An ability of a permanent that refers to the âequipped creatureâ refers to whatever creature that
          permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isnât an Equipment.</p>

        <p>301.6. Some artifacts have the subtype âFortification.â A Fortification can be attached to a land. It canât
          legally be attached to an object that isnât a land. Fortificationâs analog to the equip keyword ability is the
          fortify keyword ability. Rules 301.5aâe apply to Fortifications in relation to lands just as they apply to
          Equipment in relation to creatures, with one clarification relating to rule 301.5c: a Fortification thatâs
          also a creature (not a land) canât fortify a land. (See rule 702.66, âFortify.â)</p>

        <p>301.7. Some artifacts have the subtype âVehicle.â Vehicles have a crew ability, which allows them to become
          artifact creatures. See rule 702.121, âCrew.â</p>

        <p>301.7a Each Vehicle has a printed power and toughness, but it has these characteristics only if itâs also a
          creature. See rule 208.3.</p>

        <p>301.7b If a Vehicle becomes a creature, it immediately has its printed power and toughness. Other effects,
          including the effect that makes it a creature, may modify these values or set them to different values.</p>

        <h2 id="302">
          302. Creatures
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>302.1. A player who has priority may cast a creature card from their hand during a main phase of their turn
          when the stack is empty. Casting a creature as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â)</p>

        <p>302.2. When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>

        <p>302.3. Creature subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âCreature â Human
          Soldier,â âArtifact Creature â Golem,â and so on. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Creatures
          may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.</p>
        <p>Example: âCreature â Goblin Wizardâ means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard.</p>

        <p>302.4. Power and toughness are characteristics only creatures have.</p>

        <p>302.4a A creatureâs power is the amount of damage it deals in combat.</p>

        <p>302.4b A creatureâs toughness is the amount of damage needed to destroy it.</p>

        <p>302.4c To determine a creatureâs power and toughness, start with the numbers printed in its lower right
          corner, then apply any applicable continuous effects. (See rule 613, âInteraction of Continuous Effects.â)</p>

        <p>302.5. Creatures can attack and block. (See rule 508, âDeclare Attackers Step,â and rule 509, âDeclare
          Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>302.6. A creatureâs activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap symbol in its activation cost canât be
          activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâs control continuously since their most recent
          turn began. A creature canât attack unless it has been under its controllerâs control continuously since their
          most recent turn began. This rule is informally called the âsummoning sicknessâ rule.</p>

        <p>302.7. Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect is marked on that creature (see
          rule 120.3). If the total damage marked on that creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that
          creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage
          marked on a creature is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.15, âRegenerateâ) and during the cleanup
          step (see rule 514.2).</p>

        <h2 id="303">
          303. Enchantments
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>303.1. A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from their hand during a main phase of their
          turn when the stack is empty. Casting an enchantment as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, âCasting
          Spells.â)</p>

        <p>303.2. When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
        </p>

        <p>303.3. Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âEnchantment â
          Shrine.â Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment
          types. Enchantments may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3h for the complete list of enchantment types.
        </p>

        <p>303.4. Some enchantments have the subtype âAura.â An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an object or
          player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5, âEnchantâ).
          Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.</p>

        <p>303.4a An Aura spell requires a target, which is defined by its enchant ability.</p>

        <p>303.4b The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted. The Aura is attached to, or
          âenchants,â that object or player.</p>

        <p>303.4c If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player as defined by its enchant ability and other
          applicable effects, the object it was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has left
          the game, the Aura is put into its ownerâs graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>303.4d An Aura canât enchant itself. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its ownerâs graveyard. An
          Aura thatâs also a creature canât enchant anything. If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached, then
          is put into its ownerâs graveyard. (These are state-based actions. See rule 704.) An Aura canât enchant more
          than one object or player. If a spell or ability would cause an Aura to become attached to more than one
          object or player, the Auraâs controller chooses which object or player it becomes attached to.</p>

        <p>303.4e An Auraâs controller is separate from the enchanted objectâs controller or the enchanted player; the
          two need not be the same. If an Aura enchants an object, changing control of the object doesnât change control
          of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Auraâs controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Aura
          grants an ability to the enchanted object (with âgainsâ or âhasâ), the enchanted objectâs controller is the
          only one who can activate that ability.</p>

        <p>303.4f If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a playerâs control by any means other than by resolving
          as an Aura spell, and the effect putting it onto the battlefield doesnât specify the object or player the Aura
          will enchant, that player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the battlefield. The player must
          choose a legal object or player according to the Auraâs enchant ability and any other applicable effects.</p>

        <p>303.4g If an Aura is entering the battlefield and there is no legal object or player for it to enchant, the
          Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its
          ownerâs graveyard instead of entering the battlefield.</p>

        <p>303.4h If an effect attempts to put a permanent that isnât an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification onto the
          battlefield attached to an object or player, it enters the battlefield unattached.</p>

        <p>303.4i If an effect attempts to put an Aura onto the battlefield attached to an object or player it canât
          legally enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura
          is put into its ownerâs graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isnât
          created.</p>

        <p>303.4j If an effect attempts to attach an Aura on the battlefield to an object or player it canât legally
          enchant, the Aura doesnât move.</p>

        <p>303.4k If an effect allows an Aura thatâs being turned face up to become attached to an object or player, the
          Auraâs controller considers the characteristics of that Aura as it would exist if it were face up to determine
          what it may be attached to, and they must choose a legal object or player according to the Auraâs enchant
          ability and any other applicable effects.</p>

        <p>303.4m An ability of a permanent that refers to the âenchanted [object or player]â refers to whatever object
          or player that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isnât an Aura.</p>

        <p>303.5. Some enchantments have the subtype âSaga.â See rule 714 for more information about Saga cards.</p>

        <h2 id="304">
          304. Instants
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>304.1. A player who has priority may cast an instant card from their hand. Casting an instant as a spell uses
          the stack. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â)</p>

        <p>304.2. When an instant spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then itâs put into
          its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>304.3. Instant subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âInstant â Arcane.â Each
          word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of instant subtypes is the same as the set of sorcery
          subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Instants may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3k for the
          complete list of spell types.</p>

        <p>304.4. Instants canât enter the battlefield. If an instant would enter the battlefield, it remains in its
          previous zone instead.</p>

        <p>304.5. If text states that a player may do something âany time they could cast an instant,â it means only
          that the player must have priority. The player doesnât need to have an instant they could cast. Effects that
          would preclude that player from casting a spell or casting an instant donât affect the playerâs capability to
          perform that action (unless the action is actually casting a spell or casting an instant).</p>

        <h2 id="305">
          305. Lands
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>305.1. A player who has priority may play a land card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when
          the stack is empty. Playing a land is a special action; it doesnât use the stack (see rule 116). Rather, the
          player simply puts the land onto the battlefield. Since the land doesnât go on the stack, it is never a spell,
          and players canât respond to it with instants or activated abilities.</p>

        <p>305.2. A player can normally play one land during their turn; however, continuous effects may increase this
          number.</p>

        <p>305.2a To determine whether a player can play a land, compare the number of lands the player can play this
          turn with the number of lands they have already played this turn (including lands played as special actions
          and lands played during the resolution of spells and abilities). If the number of lands the player can play is
          greater, the play is legal.</p>

        <p>305.2b A player canât play a land, for any reason, if the number of lands the player can play this turn is
          equal to or less than the number of lands they have already played this turn. Ignore any part of an effect
          that instructs a player to do so.</p>

        <p>305.3. A player canât play a land, for any reason, if it isnât their turn. Ignore any part of an effect that
          instructs a player to do so.</p>

        <p>305.4. Effects may also allow players to âputâ lands onto the battlefield. This isnât the same as âplaying a
          landâ and doesnât count as a land played during the current turn.</p>

        <p>305.5. Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called
          land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3i for the complete list of land types.</p>
        <p>Example: âBasic Land â Mountainâ means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain.</p>

        <p>305.6. The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words
          âbasic land type,â itâs referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land
          type has the intrinsic ability â{T}: Add [mana symbol],â even if the text box doesnât actually contain that
          text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is {W}; for Islands, {U}; for Swamps, {B}; for
          Mountains, {R}; and for Forests, {G}. See rule 107.4a. See also rule 605, âMana Abilities.â</p>

        <p>305.7. If an effect sets a landâs subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its
          old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copy effects
          affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this
          doesnât remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a landâs subtype doesnât
          add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land
          may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules
          text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.</p>

        <p>305.8. Any land with the supertype âbasicâ is a basic land. Any land that doesnât have this supertype is a
          nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.</p>

        <p>305.9. If an object is both a land and another card type, it can be played only as a land. It canât be cast
          as a spell.</p>

        <h2 id="306">
          306. Planeswalkers
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>306.1. A player who has priority may cast a planeswalker card from their hand during a main phase of their
          turn when the stack is empty. Casting a planeswalker as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, âCasting
          Spells.â)</p>

        <p>306.2. When a planeswalker spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
        </p>

        <p>306.3. Planeswalker subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âPlaneswalker â
          Jace.â Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Planeswalker subtypes are also called planeswalker
          types. Planeswalkers may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3j for the complete list of planeswalker types.
        </p>

        <p>306.4. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a âplaneswalker uniqueness ruleâ that stopped a player from
          controlling two planeswalkers of the same planeswalker type. This rule has been removed and planeswalker cards
          printed before this change have received errata in the Oracle card reference to have the legendary supertype.
          Like other legendary permanents, they are subject to the âlegend ruleâ (see rule 704.5j).</p>

        <p>306.5. Loyalty is a characteristic only planeswalkers have.</p>

        <p>306.5a The loyalty of a planeswalker card not on the battlefield is equal to the number printed in its lower
          right corner.</p>

        <p>306.5b A planeswalker has the intrinsic ability âThis permanent enters the battlefield with a number of
          loyalty counters on it equal to its printed loyalty number.â This ability creates a replacement effect (see
          rule 614.1c).</p>

        <p>306.5c The loyalty of a planeswalker on the battlefield is equal to the number of loyalty counters on it.</p>

        <p>306.5d Each planeswalker has a number of loyalty abilities, which are activated abilities with loyalty
          symbols in their costs. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a
          permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn,
          but only if none of that permanentâs loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, âLoyalty
          Abilities.â</p>

        <p>306.6. Planeswalkers can be attacked. (See rule 508, âDeclare Attackers Step.â)</p>

        <p>306.7. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a redirection effect that allowed a player to have noncombat
          damage that would be dealt to an opponent be dealt to a planeswalker under that opponentâs control instead.
          This rule has been removed and certain cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to deal damage
          directly to planeswalkers.</p>

        <p>306.8. Damage dealt to a planeswalker results in that many loyalty counters being removed from it.</p>

        <p>306.9. If a planeswalkerâs loyalty is 0, itâs put into its ownerâs graveyard. (This is a state-based action.
          See rule 704.)</p>

        <h2 id="307">
          307. Sorceries
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>307.1. A player who has priority may cast a sorcery card from their hand during a main phase of their turn
          when the stack is empty. Casting a sorcery as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â)</p>

        <p>307.2. When a sorcery spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text are followed. Then itâs put into
          its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>307.3. Sorcery subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âSorcery â Arcane.â Each
          word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of sorcery subtypes is the same as the set of instant
          subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Sorceries may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3k for the
          complete list of spell types.</p>

        <p>307.4. Sorceries canât enter the battlefield. If a sorcery would enter the battlefield, it remains in its
          previous zone instead.</p>

        <p>307.5. If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something only âany time they could cast a
          sorcery,â it means only that the player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of their turn,
          and the stack must be empty. The player doesnât need to have a sorcery they could cast. Effects that would
          preclude that player from casting a spell or casting a sorcery donât affect the playerâs capability to perform
          that action (unless the action is actually casting a spell or casting a sorcery).</p>

        <p>307.5a Similarly, if an effect checks to see if a spell was cast âany time a sorcery couldnât have been
          cast,â itâs checking only whether the spellâs controller cast it without having priority, during a phase other
          than their main phase, or while another object was on the stack.</p>

        <h2 id="308">
          308. Tribals
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>308.1. Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal card follows the rules for
          casting and resolving a card of the other card type.</p>

        <p>308.2. Tribal subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: âTribal Enchantment â
          Merfolk.â The set of tribal subtypes is the same as the set of creature subtypes; these subtypes are called
          creature types. Tribals may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.
        </p>

        <h2 id="309">
          309. Planes
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>309.1. Plane is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses
          plane cards. See rule 901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>309.2. Plane cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâre part of a planar deck
          and while theyâre face up. Theyâre not permanents. They canât be cast. If a plane card would leave the command
          zone, it remains in the command zone.</p>

        <p>309.3. Plane subtypes are listed after a long dash, and may be multiple words: âPlane â Serraâs Realm.â All
          words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype. Planar subtypes are called planar types. A plane can
          have only one subtype. See rule 205.3n for the complete list of planar types.</p>

        <p>309.4. A plane card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a plane
          card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may
          trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.</p>

        <p>309.5. The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally,
          the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave
          the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnât leave the game becomes the planar controller,
          then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they
          leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.</p>

        <p>309.6. A face-up plane card thatâs turned face down becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>309.7. Each plane card has a triggered ability that triggers âWhenever you roll {CHAOS}.â These are called
          âchaos abilities.â Each one is indicated by a {CHAOS} to its left, though the symbol itself has no special
          rules meaning.</p>

        <h2 id="310">
          310. Phenomena
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>310.1. Phenomenon is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant
          uses phenomenon cards. See rule 901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>310.2. Phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâre part of a planar
          deck and while theyâre face up. Theyâre not permanents. They canât be cast. If a phenomenon card would leave
          the command zone, it remains in the command zone.</p>

        <p>310.3. Phenomenon cards have no subtypes.</p>

        <p>310.4. The controller of a face-up phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller.
          Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller
          would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnât leave the game becomes the planar
          controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation
          until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.</p>

        <p>310.5. Each phenomenon card has a triggered ability that triggers when you encounter it. âWhen you encounter
          [this phenomenon]â means âWhen you move this card off a planar deck and turn it face up.â</p>

        <p>310.6. A face-up phenomenon card thatâs turned face down becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>310.7. If a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isnât the source of a triggered ability
          that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks the next time a player would
          receive priority. (This is a state-based action; see rule 704. See also rule 701.24, âPlaneswalk.â)</p>

        <h2 id="311">
          311. Vanguards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>311.1. Vanguard is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Vanguard casual variant uses
          vanguard cards. See rule 902, âVanguard.â</p>

        <p>311.2. Vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. Theyâre not permanents. They canât be
          cast. If a vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.</p>

        <p>311.3. Vanguard cards have no subtypes.</p>

        <p>311.4. A vanguard card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a
          vanguard card is in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may
          trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.</p>

        <p>311.5. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The
          controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.</p>

        <p>311.6. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by
          a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied to the starting hand size
          and maximum hand size of the vanguard cardâs owner (normally seven). The resulting number is both how many
          cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and their maximum hand size.</p>

        <p>311.7. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by
          a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total
          of the vanguard cardâs owner (normally 20) to is determined. See rule 103.3.</p>

          312. Schemes
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>312.1. Scheme is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Archenemy casual variant uses
          scheme cards. See rule 904, âArchenemy.â</p>

        <p>312.2. Scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while theyâre part of a scheme deck
          and while theyâre face up. Theyâre not permanents. They canât be cast. If a scheme card would leave the
          command zone, it remains in the command zone.</p>

        <p>312.3. Scheme cards have no subtypes.</p>

        <p>312.4. A scheme card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a
          scheme card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may
          trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.</p>

        <p>312.5. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The
          controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.</p>

        <p>312.6. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme
          are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom
          of its ownerâs scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See
          rule 704.)</p>

        <p>312.7. If an ability of a scheme card includes the text âthis scheme,â it means the scheme card in the
          command zone thatâs the source of that ability. This is an exception to rule 109.2.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>313.1. Conspiracy cards are used only in limited play, particularly in the Conspiracy Draft variant (see rule
          905). Conspiracy cards arenât used in constructed play.</p>

        <p>313.2. At the start of a game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards
          from their sideboard into the command zone. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone
          face down. (See rule 702.105, âHidden Agenda.â)</p>

        <p>313.3. Conspiracy cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. Theyâre not permanents. They canât be
          cast or included in a deck. If a conspiracy card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
          Conspiracy cards that arenât in the game canât be brought into the game.</p>

        <p>313.4. Conspiracy cards have no subtypes.</p>

        <p>313.5. Conspiracy cards may have any number of static or triggered abilities. As long as a conspiracy card is
          face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, and its triggered abilities may trigger.
        </p>

        <p>313.5a Abilities of conspiracy cards may affect the start-of-game procedure.</p>

        <p>313.5b Face-down conspiracy cards have no characteristics.</p>

        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>400.1. A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand,
          battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Each player has
          their own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.</p>

        <p>400.2. Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cardsâ faces, except for those cards that some
          rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are
          public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cardsâ faces. Library
          and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.</p>

        <p>400.3. If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its ownerâs, it goes to its
          ownerâs corresponding zone.</p>

        <p>400.4. Cards with certain card types canât enter certain zones.</p>

        <p>400.4a If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone.</p>

        <p>400.4b If a conspiracy, phenomenon, plane, scheme, or vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains
          in the command zone.</p>

        <p>400.5. The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack canât be changed except when
          effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other
          objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether
          theyâre tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.</p>

        <p>400.6. If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the
          object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it
          to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each
          other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects,
          whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try
          to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that objectâs
          controllerâor its owner if it has no controllerâchooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does.
          (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous
          âdestroyâ effects.) Then the event moves the object.</p>
        <p>Example: Exquisite Archangel has an ability which reads âIf you would lose the game, instead exile Exquisite
          Archangel and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total.â A spell deals 5 damage to a player
          with 5 life and 5 damage to an Exquisite Archangel under that playerâs control. As state-based actions are
          performed, that playerâs life total becomes equal to their starting life total, and that player chooses
          whether Exquisite Archangel moves to its ownerâs graveyard or to exile.</p>

        <p>400.7. An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to,
          its previous existence. There are nine exceptions to this rule:</p>

        <p>400.7a Effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities that change the characteristics or
          controller of a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to the permanent that spell becomes.</p>

        <p>400.7b Prevention effects that apply to damage from a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to
          damage from the permanent that spell becomes.</p>

        <p>400.7c An ability of a permanent can reference information about the spell that became that permanent as it
          resolved, including what costs were paid to cast that spell or what mana was spent to pay those costs.</p>

        <p>400.7d Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, âWhen Rancor is put
          into a graveyard from the battlefieldâ) can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved to when
          the ability triggered, if that zone is a public zone.</p>

        <p>400.7e Abilities of Auras that trigger when the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield can find the new
          object that Aura became in its ownerâs graveyard if it was put into that graveyard at the same time the
          enchanted permanent left the battlefield. It can also find the new object that Aura became in its ownerâs
          graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not being attached to a permanent. (See
          rule 704.5m.)</p>

        <p>400.7f If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be cast, that ability will continue to
          apply to the new object that card became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>

        <p>400.7g If an effect allows a nonland card to be cast, other parts of that effect can find the new object that
          card becomes after it moves to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>

        <p>400.7h If an effect causes an object to move to a public zone, other parts of that effect can find that
          object. If the cost of a spell or ability causes an object to move to a public zone, that spell or abilityâs
          effects can find that object.</p>

        <p>400.7i After resolving a madness triggered ability (see rule 702.34), if the exiled card wasnât cast and was
          moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that object.</p>

        <p>400.8. If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesnât change zones, but it becomes a new object that
          has just been exiled.</p>

        <p>400.9. If a face-up object in the command zone is turned face down, it becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>400.10. If an object in the command zone is put into the command zone, it doesnât change zones, but it
          becomes a new object that has just entered the command zone.</p>

        <p>400.11. An object is outside the game if it isnât in any of the gameâs zones. Outside the game is not a zone.
        </p>

        <p>400.11a Cards in a playerâs sideboard are outside the game. See rule 100.4.</p>

        <p>400.11b Some effects bring cards into a game from outside of it. Those cards remain in the game until it
          ends.</p>

        <p>400.11c Cards outside the game canât be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining
          abilities printed on them (see rule 604.3) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into
          the game.</p>

        <p>400.12. Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such as âShuffle your hand into your
          libraryâ). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.</p>

        <h2 id="401">
          401. Library
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>401.1. When a game begins, each playerâs deck becomes their library.</p>

        <p>401.2. Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players canât look at or change the order of
          cards in a library.</p>

        <p>401.3. Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any playerâs library at any time.</p>

        <p>401.4. If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a library at the same time, the owner of
          those cards may arrange them in any order. That libraryâs owner doesnât reveal the order in which the cards go
          into the library.</p>

        <p>401.5. Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, or say that a player
          may look at the top card of their library. If the top card of the playerâs library changes while a spell is
          being cast, the new top card wonât be revealed and canât be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule
          601.2i). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated.</p>

        <p>401.6. If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, and that particular
          card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>401.7. If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library âNth from the top,â and that library has
          fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.</p>

        <h2 id="402">
          402. Hand
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>402.1. The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a playerâs hand by
          other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that
          playerâs starting hand size, normally seven. (See rule 103, âStarting the Game.â)</p>

        <p>402.2. Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of
          cards in their hand, but as part of their cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the
          maximum hand size.</p>

        <p>402.3. A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player canât
          look at the cards in another playerâs hand but may count those cards at any time.</p>

        <h2 id="403">
          403. Battlefield
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>403.1. Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty.
          Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of them on the battlefield, though there are some
          cases (such as an Aura attached to another playerâs permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept
          closer to a different player.</p>

        <p>403.2. A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or
          another zone.</p>

        <p>403.3. Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule
          110, âPermanents.â</p>

        <p>403.4. Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any
          previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule 400.7. (This is also true
          for any objects entering any zone.)</p>

        <p>403.5. Previously, the battlefield was called the âin-play zone.â Cards that were printed with text that
          contains the phrases âin play,â âfrom play,â âinto play,â or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards
          that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.</p>

        <h2 id="404">
          404. Graveyard
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>404.1. A playerâs graveyard is their discard pile. Any object thatâs countered, discarded, destroyed, or
          sacrificed is put on top of its ownerâs graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell thatâs finished
          resolving. Each playerâs graveyard starts out empty.</p>

        <p>404.2. Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at
          any time but normally canât change their order. Additional rules applying to sanctioned tournaments may allow
          a player to change the order of cards in their graveyard.</p>

        <p>404.3. If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of
          those cards may arrange them in any order.</p>

        <h2 id="405">
          405. Stack
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>405.1. When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule 601.2a). When an ability is
          activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules 602.2a and
          603.3).</p>

        <p>405.2. The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object
          is put on the stack, itâs put on top of all objects already there.</p>

        <p>405.3. If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active
          player are put on lowest, followed by each other playerâs objects in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). If a player
          controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.</p>

        <p>405.4. Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered
          ability thatâs on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The
          controller of a spell is the person who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who
          activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the abilityâs source when it
          triggered, unless itâs a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered
          ability, see rules 603.7dâf.</p>

        <p>405.5. When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If
          the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.</p>

        <p>405.6. Some things that happen during the game donât use the stack.</p>

        <p>405.6a Effects donât go on the stack; theyâre the result of spells and abilities resolving. Effects may
          create delayed triggered abilities, however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see rule 603.7).
        </p>

        <p>405.6b Static abilities continuously generate effects and donât go on the stack. (See rule 604, âHandling
          Static Abilities.â) This includes characteristic-defining abilities such as â[This object] is redâ (see rule
          604.3).</p>

        <p>405.6c Mana abilities resolve immediately. If a mana ability both produces mana and has another effect, the
          mana is produced and the other effect happens immediately. If a player had priority before a mana ability was
          activated, that player gets priority after it resolves. (See rule 605, âMana Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>405.6d Special actions donât use the stack; they happen immediately. See rule 116, âSpecial Actions.â</p>

        <p>405.6e Turn-based actions donât use the stack; they happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin.
          Theyâre dealt with before a player would receive priority (see rule 117.3a). Turn-based actions also happen
          automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule 703.</p>

        <p>405.6f State-based actions donât use the stack; they happen automatically when certain conditions are met.
          See rule 704. They are dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule 117.5.</p>

        <p>405.6g A player may concede the game at any time. That player leaves the game immediately. See rule 104.3a.
        </p>

        <p>405.6h If a player leaves a multiplayer game, objects may leave the game, cease to exist, change control, or
          be exiled as a result. These actions happen immediately. See rule 800.4a.</p>

        <h2 id="406">
          406. Exile
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>406.1. The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object
          without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only
          temporarily.</p>

        <p>406.2. To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone itâs currently in. An exiled
          card is a card thatâs been put into the exile zone.</p>

        <p>406.3. Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards
          âexiled face downâ canât be examined by any player except when instructions allow it. However, once a player
          is allowed to look at a card exiled face down, that player may continue to look at that card as long as it
          remains exiled, even if the instruction allowing the player to do so no longer applies. A card exiled face
          down has no characteristics, but the spell or ability that exiled it may allow it to be played from exile.
          Unless that card is being cast face down (see rule 707.4), the card is turned face up just before the player
          announces that they are playing the card (see rule 601.2).</p>

        <p>406.4. Face-down cards in exile should be kept in separate piles based on when they were exiled and how they
          were exiled. If a player is instructed to choose an exiled card, the player may choose a specific face-down
          card only if the player is allowed to look at that card. Otherwise, they may choose a pile of face-down exiled
          cards, and then a card is chosen at random from within that pile. If choosing such a card is part of casting a
          spell or activating an ability, the chosen card isnât revealed until after that cost is fully paid. (See rule
          601.2i.)</p>

        <p>406.5. Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles
          to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to
          their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise
          be kept in separate piles.</p>

        <p>406.6. An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another
          ability that refers either to âthe exiled cardsâ or to cards âexiled with [this object].â These abilities are
          linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule 607, âLinked
          Abilities.â</p>

        <p>406.7. If an object in the exile zone becomes exiled, it doesnât change zones, but it becomes a new object
          that has just been exiled.</p>

        <p>406.8. Previously, the exile zone was called the âremoved-from-the-game zone.â Cards that were printed with
          text that âremoves [an object] from the gameâ exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text
          that âsets [an object] aside.â Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card
          reference.</p>

        <h2 id="407">
          407. Ante
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>407.1. Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing âfor keeps.â Playing
          Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and itâs allowed only where itâs not
          forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering
          Tournament Rules (WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents).</p>

        <p>407.2. When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from their deck into the ante zone after
          determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards. Cards in the ante zone may be examined
          by any player at any time. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in the ante
          zone.</p>

        <p>407.3. A few cards have the text âRemove [this card] from your deck before playing if youâre not playing for
          ante.â These are the only cards that can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a cardâs owner. When
          not playing for ante, players canât include these cards in their decks or sideboards, and these cards canât be
          brought into the game from outside the game.</p>

        <p>407.4. To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from whichever zone itâs currently in. The
          owner of an object is the only person who can ante that object.</p>

          408. Command
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>408.1. The command zone is a game area reserved for certain specialized objects that have an overarching
          effect on the game, yet are not permanents and cannot be destroyed.</p>

        <p>408.2. Emblems may be created in the command zone. See rule 114, âEmblems.â</p>

        <p>408.3. In the Planechase, Vanguard, Commander, Archenemy, and Conspiracy Draft casual variants,
          nontraditional Magic cards and/or specially designated cards start the game in the command zone. Each variant
          has its own rules regarding such cards. See section 9, âCasual Variants.â</p>

          500. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>500.1. A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and
          ending. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning,
          combat, and ending phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.</p>

        <p>500.2. A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in
          succession. Simply having the stack become empty doesnât cause such a phase or step to end; all players have
          to pass in succession with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to
          the stack before that phase or step ends.</p>

        <p>500.3. A step in which no players receive priority ends when all specified actions that take place during
          that step are completed. The only such steps are the untap step (see rule 502) and certain cleanup steps (see
          rule 514).</p>

        <p>500.4. When a step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a playerâs mana pool empties. This turn-based
          action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <p>500.5. When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last âuntil end ofâ that phase or step expire.
          When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last âuntilâ that phase or step expire. Effects that
          last âuntil end of combatâ expire at the end of the combat phase, not at the beginning of the end of combat
          step. Effects that last âuntil end of turnâ are subject to special rules; see rule 514.2.</p>

        <p>500.6. When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger âat the beginning ofâ that phase or step
          trigger. They are put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and
          Priority.â)</p>

        <p>500.7. Some effects can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the
          specified turn. If a player is given multiple extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time. If
          multiple players are given extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time, in APNAP order (see rule
          101.4). The most recently created turn will be taken first.</p>

        <p>500.8. Some effects can add phases to a turn. They do this by adding the phases directly after the specified
          phase. If multiple extra phases are created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur
          first.</p>

        <p>500.9. Some effects can add steps to a phase. They do this by adding the steps directly after a specified
          step or directly before a specified step. If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most
          recently created step will occur first.</p>

        <p>500.10. Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped. To skip a step, phase, or turn is to
          proceed past it as though it didnât exist. See rule 614.10.</p>

        <p>500.11. No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps.</p>

        <h2 id="501">
          501. Beginning Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>501.1. The beginning phase consists of three steps, in this order: untap, upkeep, and draw.</p>

        <h2 id="502">
          502. Untap Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>502.1. First, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all
          phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens
          simultaneously. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. See rule 702.25, âPhasing.â</p>

        <p>502.2. Second, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them
          all simultaneously. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. Normally, all of a playerâs permanents
          untap, but effects can keep one or more of a playerâs permanents from untapping.</p>

        <p>502.3. No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells can be cast or resolve and no
          abilities can be activated or resolve. Any ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next
          time a player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep step. (See rule 503, âUpkeep Step.â)
        </p>

        <h2 id="503">
          503. Upkeep Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>503.1. The upkeep step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule
          117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>503.1a Any abilities that triggered during the untap step and any abilities that triggered at the beginning
          of the upkeep are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered
          doesnât matter. (See rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>503.2. If a spell states that it may be cast only âafter [a playerâs] upkeep step,â and the turn has multiple
          upkeep steps, that spell may be cast any time after the first upkeep step ends.</p>

        <h2 id="504">
          504. Draw Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>504.1. First, the active player draws a card. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <p>504.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <h2 id="505">
          505. Main Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>505.1. There are two main phases in a turn. In each turn, the first main phase (also known as the precombat
          main phase) and the second main phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the combat
          phase (see rule 506, âCombat Phaseâ). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and
          collectively known as the main phase.</p>

        <p>505.1a Only the first main phase of the turn is a precombat main phase. All other main phases are postcombat
          main phases. This includes the second main phase of a turn in which the combat phase has been skipped. It is
          also true of a turn in which an effect has caused an additional combat phase and an additional main phase to
          be created.</p>

        <p>505.2. The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players pass in succession while the stack
          is empty. (See rule 500.2.)</p>

        <p>505.3. First, but only if the players are playing an Archenemy game (see rule 904), the active player is the
          archenemy, and itâs the active playerâs precombat main phase, the active player sets the top card of their
          scheme deck in motion (see rule 701.25). This turn-based action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <p>505.4. Second, if the active player controls one or more Saga enchantments and itâs the active playerâs
          precombat main phase, the active player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control. (See rule 714, âSaga
          Cards.â) This turn-based action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <p>505.5. Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>505.5a The main phase is the only phase in which a player can normally cast artifact, creature, enchantment,
          planeswalker, and sorcery spells. The active player may cast these spells.</p>

        <p>505.5b During either main phase, the active player may play one land card from their hand if the stack is
          empty, if the player has priority, and if they havenât played a land this turn (unless an effect states the
          player may play additional lands). This action doesnât use the stack. Neither the land nor the action of
          playing the land is a spell or ability, so it canât be countered, and players canât respond to it with
          instants or activated abilities. (See rule 305, âLands.â)</p>

        <h2 id="506">
          506. Combat Phase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>506.1. The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers,
          declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped
          if no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking (see rule 508.8). There are
          two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double
          strike (see rule 702.4).</p>

        <p>506.2. During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player; creatures that player controls may
          attack. During the combat phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that
          player and planeswalkers they control may be attacked.</p>

        <p>506.2a During the combat phase of a multiplayer game, there may be one or more defending players, depending
          on the variant being played and the options chosen for it. Unless all the attacking playerâs opponents
          automatically become defending players during the combat phase, the attacking player chooses one of their
          opponents as a turn-based action during the beginning of combat step. (Note that the choice may be dictated by
          the variant being played or the options chosen for it.) That player becomes the defending player. See rule
          802, âAttack Multiple Players Option,â rule 803, âAttack Left and Attack Right Options,â and rule 809,
          âEmperor Variant.â</p>

        <p>506.2b In multiplayer games using the shared team turns option, the active team is the attacking team and the
          nonactive team is the defending team. See rule 805, âShared Team Turns Option.â</p>

        <p>506.3. Only a creature can attack or block. Only a player or a planeswalker can be attacked.</p>

        <p>506.3a If an effect would put a noncreature permanent onto the battlefield attacking or blocking, the
          permanent does enter the battlefield but itâs never considered to be an attacking or blocking permanent.</p>

        <p>506.3b If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking under the control of any player
          except an attacking player, that creature does enter the battlefield, but itâs never considered to be an
          attacking creature.</p>

        <p>506.3c If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking either a player not in the game or a
          planeswalker no longer on the battlefield or no longer a planeswalker, that creature does enter the
          battlefield, but itâs never considered to be an attacking creature.</p>

        <p>506.3d If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield blocking but the creature it would block isnât
          attacking either the first creatureâs controller or a planeswalker that player controls, that creature does
          enter the battlefield, but itâs never considered to be a blocking creature.</p>

        <p>506.4. A permanent is removed from combat if it leaves the battlefield, if its controller changes, if it
          phases out, if an effect specifically removes it from combat, if itâs a planeswalker thatâs being attacked and
          stops being a planeswalker, or if itâs an attacking or blocking creature that regenerates (see rule 701.15) or
          stops being a creature. A creature thatâs removed from combat stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked,
          and/or unblocked creature. A planeswalker thatâs removed from combat stops being attacked.</p>

        <p>506.4a Once a creature has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature, spells or abilities that would
          have kept that creature from attacking or blocking donât remove the creature from combat.</p>

        <p>506.4b Tapping or untapping a creature thatâs already been declared as an attacker or blocker doesnât remove
          it from combat and doesnât prevent its combat damage.</p>

        <p>506.4c If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, removing that planeswalker from combat doesnât remove that
          creature from combat. It continues to be an attacking creature, although it is attacking neither a player nor
          a planeswalker. It may be blocked. If it is unblocked, it will deal no combat damage.</p>

        <p>506.4d A permanent thatâs both a blocking creature and a planeswalker thatâs being attacked is removed from
          combat if it stops being both a creature and a planeswalker. If it stops being one of those card types but
          continues to be the other, it continues to be either a blocking creature or a planeswalker thatâs being
          attacked, whichever is appropriate.</p>

        <p>506.5. A creature attacks alone if itâs the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare
          attackers step. A creature is attacking alone if itâs attacking but no other creatures are. A creature blocks
          alone if itâs the only creature declared as a blocker during the declare blockers step. A creature is blocking
          alone if itâs blocking but no other creatures are.</p>

        <p>506.6. Some spells state that they may be cast âonly [before/after] [a particular point in the combat
          phase],â in which that point may be âattackers are declared,â âblockers are declared,â âthe combat damage
          step,â âthe end of combat step,â âthe combat phase,â or âcombat.â</p>

        <p>506.6a A spell that states it may be cast âonly before (or after) attackers are declaredâ is referring to the
          turn-based action of declaring attackers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare attackers step
          begins, regardless of whether any attackers are actually declared. (See rule 508.)</p>

        <p>506.6b A spell that states it may be cast âonly before (or after) blockers are declaredâ is referring to the
          turn-based action of declaring blockers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare blockers step
          begins, regardless of whether any blockers are actually declared. (See rule 509.)</p>

        <p>506.6c Some spells state that they may be cast only âduring combatâ or âduring a certain playerâs combat
          phaseâ in addition to the criteria described in rule 506.6. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells
          may be cast at an appropriate time during any of them.</p>

        <p>506.6d Some spells state that they may be cast âonly before (or after) [a particular point in the combat
          phase],â but donât meet the additional criteria described in rule 506.6c. If a turn has multiple combat
          phases, such spells may be cast that turn only before (or after) the stated point of the first combat phase.
        </p>

        <p>506.6e If a spell states that it may be cast âonly before [a particular point in the combat phase],â but the
          stated point doesnât exist within the relevant combat phase because the declare blockers step and the combat
          damage step are skipped (see rule 508.8), then the spell may be cast only before the declare attackers step
          ends. If the stated point doesnât exist because the relevant combat phase has been skipped, then the spell may
          be cast only before the precombat main phase ends.</p>

        <p>506.6f If a spell states that it may be cast âonly during combat after blockers are declared,â but the
          declare blockers step is skipped that combat phase (see rule 508.8), then the spell may not be cast during
          that combat phase.</p>

        <p>506.6g Rules 506.6 and 506.6aâf apply to abilities that state that they may be activated only at certain
          times with respect to combat just as they apply to spells that state that they may be cast only at certain
          times with respect to combat.</p>

        <h2 id="507">
          507. Beginning of Combat Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>507.1. First, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the active playerâs opponents donât all
          automatically become defending players, the active player chooses one of their opponents. That player becomes
          the defending player. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. (See rule 506.2.)</p>

        <p>507.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <h2 id="508">
          508. Declare Attackers Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>508.1. First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. To declare
          attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of
          attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is
          illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 723, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>508.1a The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures
          must be untapped, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player
          continuously since the turn began.</p>

        <p>508.1b If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, or the game allows the active player to attack
          multiple other players, the active player announces which player or planeswalker each of the chosen creatures
          is attacking.</p>

        <p>508.1c The active player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any restrictions
          (effects that say a creature canât attack, or that it canât attack unless some condition is met). If any
          restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states â[This creature] canât attack
          alone.â Itâs legal to declare both as attackers.</p>

        <p>508.1d The active player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any requirements
          (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of
          requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be
          obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature canât
          attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that
          creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks
          if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able
          during each declare attackers step in that turn.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls two creatures: one that âattacks if ableâ and one with no abilities. An effect
          states âNo more than one creature can attack each turn.â The only legal attack is for just the creature that
          âattacks if ableâ to attack. Itâs illegal to attack with the other creature, attack with both, or attack with
          neither.</p>

        <p>508.1e If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a âbands with otherâ ability, the active player
          announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule 702.21, âBanding.â)</p>

        <p>508.1f The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when itâs declared as an attacker
          isnât a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.</p>

        <p>508.1g If there are any optional costs to attack with the chosen creatures (expressed as costs a player may
          pay âasâ a creature attacks), the active player chooses which, if any, they will pay.</p>

        <p>508.1h If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, or if any optional costs to attack were
          chosen, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping
          permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes
          âlocked in.â If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.</p>

        <p>508.1i If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see
          rule 605, âMana Abilitiesâ).</p>

        <p>508.1j Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments
          are not allowed.</p>

        <p>508.1k Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes an attacking creature. It remains
          an attacking creature until itâs removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule
          506.4.</p>

        <p>508.1m Any abilities that trigger on attackers being declared trigger.</p>

        <p>508.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>508.2a Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as
          an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creatureâs characteristics change to
          match the abilityâs trigger condition.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent has the ability âWhenever a green creature attacks, destroy that creature at end of
          combat.â If a blue creature attacks and is later turned green, the ability will not trigger.</p>

        <p>508.2b Any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared or that triggered during the process
          described in rules 508.1 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which
          they triggered doesnât matter. (See rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>508.3. Triggered abilities that trigger on attackers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
        </p>

        <p>508.3a An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] attacks, . . .â triggers if that creature is declared as
          an attacker. Similarly, âWhenever [a creature] attacks [a player or planeswalker], . . .â triggers if that
          creature is declared as an attacker attacking that player or planeswalker. Such abilities wonât trigger if a
          creature is put onto the battlefield attacking.</p>

        <p>508.3b An ability that reads âWhenever [a player or planeswalker] is attacked, . . .â triggers if one or more
          creatures are declared as attackers attacking that player or planeswalker. It wonât trigger if a creature is
          put onto the battlefield attacking that player or planeswalker.</p>

        <p>508.3c An ability that reads âWhenever [a player] attacks with [a creature], . . .â triggers whenever a
          creature that player controls is declared as an attacker.</p>

        <p>508.3d An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] attacks and isnât blocked, . . .â triggers during the
          declare blockers step, not the declare attackers step. See rule 509.5g.</p>

        <p>508.4. If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or
          which planeswalker a defending player controls itâs attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect
          that put it onto the battlefield specifies what itâs attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a
          creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player
          controls itâs attacking it becomes attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are
          âattackingâ but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never âattacked.â</p>

        <p>508.4a If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield attacking specifies itâs attacking a certain
          player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature is put onto the
          battlefield but is never considered an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature
          is put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield or
          is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.</p>

        <p>508.4b If the effect that states a creature is attacking specifies itâs attacking a certain player, and that
          player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature doesnât become an attacking creature.
          The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no
          longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.</p>

        <p>508.4c A creature thatâs put onto the battlefield attacking or that is stated to be attacking isnât affected
          by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.</p>

        <p>508.5. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to
          both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player itâs
          referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is
          attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player itâs referring to is the player that
          creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature
          was attacking before it was removed from combat.</p>

        <p>508.5a In a multiplayer game, any rule, object, or effect that refers to a âdefending playerâ refers to one
          specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple
          attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking
          creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or
          ability chooses one.</p>

        <p>508.6. A player is âattacking [a player]â if the first player controls a creature that is attacking the
          second player. A player has âattacked [a player]â if the first player declared one or more creatures as
          attackers attacking the second player.</p>

        <p>508.7. One card (Portal Mage) allows a player to reselect which player or planeswalker a creature is
          attacking.</p>

        <p>508.7a The attacking creature isnât removed from combat and it isnât considered to have attacked a second
          time. That creature is attacking the reselected player or planeswalker, but itâs still considered to have
          attacked the player or planeswalker chosen as it was declared as an attacker.</p>

        <p>508.7b While reselecting which player or planeswalker a creature is attacking, that creature isnât affected
          by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.</p>

        <p>508.7c The reselected player or planeswalker must be an opponent of the attacking creatureâs controller, or a
          planeswalker controlled by an opponent of the attacking creatureâs controller.</p>

        <p>508.7d In a multiplayer game not using the attack multiple players option (see rule 802), the reselected
          player or planeswalker must be the chosen defending player or a planeswalker controlled by that player.</p>

        <p>508.7e In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801), the reselected
          player or planeswalker must be within the range of influence of the attacking creatureâs controller.</p>

        <p>508.8. If no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking, skip the declare
          blockers and combat damage steps.</p>

          509. Declare Blockers Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>509.1. First, the defending player declares blockers. This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. To
          declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the
          declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the
          declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 723, âHandling Illegal
          Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>509.1a The defending player chooses which creatures they control, if any, will block. The chosen creatures
          must be untapped. For each of the chosen creatures, the defending player chooses one creature for it to block
          thatâs attacking that player or a planeswalker they control.</p>

        <p>509.1b The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any
          restrictions (effects that say a creature canât block, or that it canât block unless some condition is met).
          If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of blockers is illegal.</p>
        <p>A restriction may be created by an evasion ability (a static ability an attacking creature has that restricts
          what can block it). If an attacking creature gains or loses an evasion ability after a legal block has been
          declared, it doesnât affect that block. Different evasion abilities are cumulative.</p>
        <p>Example: An attacking creature with flying and shadow canât be blocked by a creature with flying but without
          shadow.</p>

        <p>509.1c The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether itâs affected by any
          requirements (effects that say a creature must block, or that it must block if some condition is met). If the
          number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that
          could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal. If a creature
          canât block unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if blocking with
          that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature
          blocks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature blocks if able
          during each declare blockers step in that turn.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls one creature that âblocks if ableâ and another creature with no abilities. If a
          creature with menace attacks that player, the player must block with both creatures. Having only the first
          creature block violates the restriction created by menace (the attacking creature canât be blocked except by
          two or more creatures). Having only the second creature block violates both the menace restriction and the
          first creatureâs blocking requirement. Having neither creature block fulfills the restriction but not the
          requirement.</p>

        <p>509.1d If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to block, the defending player determines the
          total cost to block. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding
          cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes âlocked in.â If effects would change the total
          cost after this time, ignore this change.</p>

        <p>509.1e If any of the costs require mana, the defending player then has a chance to activate mana abilities
          (see rule 605, âMana Abilitiesâ).</p>

        <p>509.1f Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments
          are not allowed.</p>

        <p>509.1g Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player becomes a blocking creature. Each one is
          blocking the attacking creatures chosen for it. It remains a blocking creature until itâs removed from combat
          or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 506.4.</p>

        <p>509.1h An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked
          creature; one with no creatures declared as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature. This remains
          unchanged until the creature is removed from combat, an effect says that it becomes blocked or unblocked, or
          the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. A creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it
          are removed from combat.</p>

        <p>509.1i Any abilities that trigger on blockers being declared trigger. See rule 509.4 for more information.
        </p>

        <p>509.2. Second, for each attacking creature thatâs become blocked, the active player announces that creatureâs
          damage assignment order, which consists of the creatures blocking it in an order of that playerâs choice.
          (During the combat damage step, an attacking creature canât assign combat damage to a creature thatâs blocking
          it unless each creature ahead of that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This
          turn-based action doesnât use the stack.</p>
        <p>Example: Vastwood Gorger is blocked by Llanowar Elves, Runeclaw Bear, and Serra Angel. Vastwood Gorgerâs
          controller announces the Vastwood Gorgerâs damage assignment order as Serra Angel, then Llanowar Elves, then
          Runeclaw Bear.</p>

        <p>509.2a During the declare blockers step, if a blocking creature is removed from combat or a spell or ability
          causes it to stop blocking an attacking creature, the blocking creature is removed from all relevant damage
          assignment orders. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged.</p>

        <p>509.3. Third, for each blocking creature, the defending player announces that creatureâs damage assignment
          order, which consists of the creatures itâs blocking in an order of that playerâs choice. (During the combat
          damage step, a blocking creature canât assign combat damage to a creature itâs blocking unless each creature
          ahead of that blocked creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This turn-based action doesnât use the
          stack.</p>

        <p>509.3a During the declare blockers step, if an attacking creature is removed from combat or a spell or
          ability causes it to stop being blocked by a blocking creature, the attacking creature is removed from all
          relevant damage assignment orders. The relative order among the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged.
        </p>

        <p>509.4. Fourth, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>509.4a Any abilities that triggered on blockers being declared or that triggered during the process described
          in rules 509.1â3 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they
          triggered doesnât matter. (See rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>509.5. Triggered abilities that trigger on blockers being declared may have different trigger conditions.</p>

        <p>509.5a An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] blocks, . . .â generally triggers only once each combat
          for that creature, even if it blocks multiple creatures. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker.
          It will also trigger if that creature becomes a blocker as the result of an effect, but only if it wasnât a
          blocking creature at that time. (See rule 509.1g.) It wonât trigger if the creature is put onto the
          battlefield blocking.</p>

        <p>509.5b An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .â triggers once for each
          attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker.
          It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasnât
          already blocking that attacking creature at that time. It wonât trigger if the creature is put onto the
          battlefield blocking.</p>

        <p>509.5c An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] becomes blocked, . . .â generally triggers only once each
          combat for that creature, even if itâs blocked by multiple creatures. It will trigger if that creature becomes
          blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked
          by an effect or by a creature thatâs put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature
          was an unblocked creature at that time. (See rule 509.1h.)</p>

        <p>509.5d An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] becomes blocked by a creature, . . .â triggers once for
          each creature that blocks the named creature. It triggers if a creature is declared as a blocker for the
          attacking creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but
          only if it wasnât already blocking that attacking creature at that time. In addition, it will trigger if a
          creature is put onto the battlefield blocking that creature. It wonât trigger if the creature becomes blocked
          by an effect rather than a creature.</p>

        <p>509.5e If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures,
          the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared.
          Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to trigger. This applies to abilities that
          trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.</p>

        <p>509.5f If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics blocks, it will trigger only if
          the creature has those characteristics at the point blockers are declared, or at the point an effect causes it
          to block. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger
          only if the creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked creature. If an ability
          triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if
          the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those
          abilities will trigger if the relevant creatureâs characteristics change to match the abilityâs trigger
          condition later on.</p>
        <p>Example: A creature has the ability âWhenever this creature becomes blocked by a white creature, destroy that
          creature at end of combat.â If the creature becomes blocked by a black creature that is later turned white,
          the ability will not trigger.</p>

        <p>509.5g An ability that reads âWhenever [a creature] attacks and isnât blocked, . . .â triggers if no
          creatures are declared as blockers for that creature. It will trigger even if the creature was never declared
          as an attacker (for example, if it entered the battlefield attacking). It wonât trigger if the attacking
          creature is blocked and then all its blockers are removed from combat.</p>

        <p>509.6. If a spell or ability causes a creature on the battlefield to block an attacking creature, the active
          player announces the blocking creatureâs placement in the attacking creatureâs damage assignment order. The
          relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. Then the defending player announces the
          attacking creatureâs placement in the blocking creatureâs damage assignment order. The relative order among
          the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged. This is done as part of the blocking effect.</p>

        <p>509.7. If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature
          itâs blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what
          itâs blocking), then the active player announces the new creatureâs placement in the blocked creatureâs damage
          assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. A creature put onto
          the battlefield this way is âblockingâ but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never
          âblocked.â</p>
        <p>Example: Giant Spider is blocked by Canyon Minotaur. The defending player casts Flash Foliage, which creates
          a Saproling creature token blocking the Giant Spider. Giant Spiderâs controller announces the Giant Spiderâs
          damage assignment order as the Saproling token, then Canyon Minotaur.</p>

        <p>509.7a If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield blocking specifies itâs blocking a certain
          creature and that creature is no longer attacking, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never
          considered a blocking creature. The same is true if the controller of the creature thatâs put onto the
          battlefield blocking isnât a defending player for the specified attacking creature.</p>

        <p>509.7b A creature thatâs put onto the battlefield blocking isnât affected by requirements or restrictions
          that apply to the declaration of blockers.</p>

        <h2 id="510">
          510. Combat Damage Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>510.1. First, the active player announces how each attacking creature assigns its combat damage, then the
          defending player announces how each blocking creature assigns its combat damage. This turn-based action
          doesnât use the stack. A player assigns a creatureâs combat damage according to the following rules:</p>

        <p>510.1a Each attacking creature and each blocking creature assigns combat damage equal to its power. Creatures
          that would assign 0 or less damage this way donât assign combat damage at all.</p>

        <p>510.1b An unblocked creature assigns its combat damage to the player or planeswalker itâs attacking. If it
          isnât currently attacking anything (if, for example, it was attacking a planeswalker that has left the
          battlefield), it assigns no combat damage.</p>

        <p>510.1c A blocked creature assigns its combat damage to the creatures blocking it. If no creatures are
          currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat
          damage. If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or
          more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage
          assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocked creature to divide its combat damage. However,
          it canât assign combat damage to a creature thatâs blocking it unless, when combat damage assignments are
          complete, each creature that precedes that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage. When
          checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from
          other creatures thatâs being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects
          that might change the amount of damage thatâs actually dealt. An amount of damage thatâs greater than a
          creatureâs lethal damage may be assigned to it.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a
          0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2
          damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1 damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a
          0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player
          casts Giant Growth targeting Pride Guardian, which gives it +3/+3 until end of turn. Vastwood Gorger must
          assign its 5 damage to the Guardian.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a
          0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player
          casts Mending Hands targeting Pride Guardian, which prevents the next 4 damage that would be dealt to it.
          Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2 damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1
          damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.</p>
        <p>Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Enormous Baloth (a 7/7 creature) is Trained Armodon (a
          3/3 creature) that already has 2 damage marked on it, then Foriysian Brigade (a 2/4 creature that can block an
          additional creature), then Silverback Ape (a 5/5 creature). The damage assignment order of an attacking
          Durkwood Boars (a 4/4 creature) is the same Foriysian Brigade, then Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature). Among other
          possibilities, the active player may have the Baloth assign 1 damage to the Armodon, 1 damage to the Brigade,
          and 5 damage to the Ape, and have the Boars assign 3 damage to the Brigade and 1 damage to the Piker.</p>

        <p>510.1d A blocking creature assigns combat damage to the creatures itâs blocking. If it isnât currently
          blocking any creatures (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat
          damage. If itâs blocking exactly one creature, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If itâs
          blocking two or more creatures, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage
          assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocking creature to divide its combat damage. However,
          it canât assign combat damage to a creature that itâs blocking unless, when combat damage assignments are
          complete, each creature that precedes that blocked creature is assigned lethal damage. When checking for
          assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other
          creatures thatâs being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that
          might change the amount of damage thatâs actually dealt. An amount of damage thatâs greater than a creatureâs
          lethal damage may be assigned to it.</p>

        <p>510.1e Once a player has assigned combat damage from each attacking or blocking creature they control, the
          total damage assignment (not solely the damage assignment of any individual attacking or blocking creature) is
          checked to see if it complies with the above rules. If it doesnât, the combat damage assignment is illegal;
          the game returns to the moment before that player began to assign combat damage. (See rule 723, âHandling
          Illegal Actions.â)</p>

        <p>510.2. Second, all combat damage thatâs been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesnât
          use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is
          assigned and the time itâs dealt.</p>
        <p>Example: Squadron Hawk (a 1/1 creature with flying) and Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature) are attacking. Mogg
          Fanatic (a 1/1 creature with the ability âSacrifice Mogg Fanatic: Mogg Fanatic deals 1 damage to any target.â)
          blocks the Goblin Piker. The defending player sacrifices Mogg Fanatic during the declare blockers step to deal
          1 damage to the Squadron Hawk. The Hawk is destroyed. The Piker deals and is dealt no combat damage this turn.
          If the defending player instead left Mogg Fanatic on the battlefield, the Fanatic and the Piker would have
          dealt lethal damage to one another, but the Squadron Hawk couldnât have been dealt damage.</p>

        <p>510.3. Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>510.3a Any abilities that triggered on damage being dealt or while state-based actions are performed
          afterward are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered
          doesnât matter. (See rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>510.4. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see
          rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are
          those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step,
          the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the
          remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage
          step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that
          step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.</p>

          (See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>511.2. Abilities that trigger âat end of combatâ trigger as the end of combat step begins. Effects that last
          âuntil end of combatâ expire at the end of the combat phase.</p>

        <p>511.3. As soon as the end of combat step ends, all creatures and planeswalkers are removed from combat. After
          the end of combat step ends, the combat phase is over and the postcombat main phase begins (see rule 505).</p>

          117, âTiming and Priority.â)</p>

        <p>513.1a Previously, abilities that triggered at the beginning of the end step were printed with the trigger
          condition âat end of turn.â Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card
          reference to say âat the beginning of the end stepâ or âat the beginning of the next end step.â</p>

        <p>513.2. If a permanent with an ability that triggers âat the beginning of the end stepâ enters the battlefield
          during this step, that ability wonât trigger until the next turnâs end step. Likewise, if a delayed triggered
          ability that triggers âat the beginning of the next end stepâ is created during this step, that ability wonât
          trigger until the next turnâs end step. In other words, the step doesnât âback upâ so those abilities can go
          on the stack. This rule applies only to triggered abilities; it doesnât apply to continuous effects whose
          durations say âuntil end of turnâ or âthis turn.â (See rule 514, âCleanup Step.â)</p>

        <h2 id="514">
          514. Cleanup Step
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>514.1. First, if the active playerâs hand contains more cards than their maximum hand size (normally seven),
          they discard enough cards to reduce their hand size to that number. This turn-based action doesnât use the
          stack.</p>

        <p>514.2. Second, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage marked on permanents (including
          phased-out permanents) is removed and all âuntil end of turnâ and âthis turnâ effects end. This turn-based
          action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <p>514.3. Normally, no player receives priority during the cleanup step, so no spells can be cast and no
          abilities can be activated. However, this rule is subject to the following exception:</p>

        <p>514.3a At this point, the game checks to see if any state-based actions would be performed and/or any
          triggered abilities are waiting to be put onto the stack (including those that trigger âat the beginning of
          the next cleanup stepâ). If so, those state-based actions are performed, then those triggered abilities are
          put on the stack, then the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities. Once
          the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, another cleanup step begins.</p>

          601. Casting Spells
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>601.1. Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as
          âplayingâ that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle
          card reference so they now refer to âcastingâ that spell or that card.</p>

        <p>601.1a Some effects still refer to âplayingâ a card. âPlaying a cardâ means playing that card as a land or
          casting that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.</p>

        <p>601.2. To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its
          costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell
          (rules 601.2aâd) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2fâh). To cast a spell, a player follows
          the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process
          (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while
          performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal ; the game returns to the moment before the casting
          of that spell was proposed (see rule 723, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>601.2a To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where
          it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or
          the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. The spell remains on the stack
          until itâs countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>601.2b If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the player wishes to
          splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.46), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has
          alternative or additional costs that will be paid as itâs being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see
          rules 118.8 and 118.9), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule
          601.2f). A player canât apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell.
          If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as itâs being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see
          rule 107.3), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the
          text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell,
          that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the
          spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they
          intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the
          player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or the corresponding colored mana cost for each of those
          symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing
          to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the playerâs options when making these choices.</p>

        <p>601.2c The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell
          requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost)
          or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those
          targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was
          chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will
          choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spellâs
          text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesnât change, even if the
          information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target canât be chosen multiple times for
          any one instance of the word âtargetâ on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word âtargetâ in multiple
          places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word âtargetâ (as long as it
          fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the
          player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any
          rules or effects that say that an object or player canât be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or
          players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players
          become the target of a spell trigger at this point; theyâll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has
          finished being cast.)</p>
        <p>Example: If a spell says âTap two target creatures,â then the same creature canât be chosen twice; the spell
          requires two different legal targets. A spell that says âDestroy target artifact and target land,â however,
          can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word âtargetâ in multiple places.</p>

        <p>601.2d If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among
          one or more targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of
          whatever is being divided.</p>

        <p>601.2e The game checks to see if the proposed spell can legally be cast. If the proposed spell is illegal,
          the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 723, âHandling Illegal
          Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>601.2f The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells
          have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide
          other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding
          cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all
          additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the
          player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost
          reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It canât be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is
          determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes
          âlocked in.â If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.</p>

        <p>601.2g If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities
          (see rule 605, âMana Abilitiesâ). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.</p>

        <p>601.2h The player pays the total cost in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs canât
          be paid.</p>
        <p>Example: You cast Altarâs Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You
          sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spellâs
          total cost is âlocked inâ before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though youâre
          sacrificing the Familiar.</p>

        <p>601.2i Once the steps described in 601.2aâh are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the
          spell as itâs cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast
          or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spellâs controller had priority before casting it, they get
          priority.</p>

        <p>601.3. A player can begin to cast a spell only if a rule or effect allows that player to cast it and no rule
          or effect prohibits that player from casting it.</p>

        <p>601.3a If an effect prohibits a player from casting a spell with certain qualities, that player may consider
          any choices to be made during that spellâs proposal that may cause those qualities to change. If any such
          choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may
          begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Void Winnower, which reads, in part, âYour opponents can't cast spells with even
          converted mana costs.â That playerâs opponent may begin to cast Rolling Thunder, a card whose mana cost is
          {X}{R}{R}, because the chosen value of X may cause the spellâs converted mana cost to become odd.</p>

        <p>601.3b If an effect allows a player to cast a spell with certain qualities as though it had flash, that
          player may consider any choices to be made during that spellâs proposal that may cause that spellâs qualities
          to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as
          though it had flash.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect says that you may cast Aura spells as though they had flash, and you have a creature card
          with bestow in your hand. Because choosing the bestow abilityâs alternative cost causes that spell to become
          an Aura spell, you may legally begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.</p>

        <p>601.3c If an effect allows a player to cast a spell as though it had flash only if an alternative or
          additional cost is paid, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.</p>

        <p>601.3d If a spell would have flash only if certain conditions are met, its controller may begin to cast that
          spell as though it had flash if those conditions are met.</p>

        <p>601.3e Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics
          are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics
          replace the objectâs characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that
          object once it has those characteristics are also considered.</p>
        <p>Example: Garrukâs Horde says, in part, âYou may cast creature spells from the top of your library.â If you
          control Garrukâs Horde and the top card of your library is a noncreature card with morph, you may cast it
          using its morph ability.</p>
        <p>Example: Melek, Izzet Paragon says, in part, âYou may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your
          library.â If you control Melek, Izzet Paragon and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, an adventurer
          creature card whose Adventure is an instant named Chop Down, you may cast Chop Down but not Giant Killer. If
          instead you control Garrukâs Horde and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, you may cast Giant Killer
          but not Chop Down.</p>

        <p>601.4. If a player is no longer allowed to cast a spell after completing its proposal (see rules 601.2aâd),
          the casting of the spell is illegal and the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was
          proposed (see rule 723, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). It doesnât matter if a rule or effect would make the
          casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spellâs costs (see rules 601.2f-h) or any time
          after the spell has been cast.</p>

        <p>601.5. Some spells specify that one of their controllerâs opponents does something the controller would
          normally do while itâs being cast, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does
          so when the spellâs controller normally would do so.</p>

        <p>601.5a If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the spellâs controller decides which
          of those opponents will make the choice.</p>

        <p>601.5b If the spell instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the spell
          is being cast, the spellâs controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.
        </p>

        <p>601.6. Casting a spell that alters costs wonât affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.</p>

        <h2 id="602">
          602. Activating Activated Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>602.1. Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as â[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation
          instructions (if any).]â</p>

        <p>602.1a The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An abilityâs activation cost must be paid by
          the player who is activating it.</p>
        <p>Example: The activation cost of an ability that reads â{2}, {T}: You gain 1 lifeâ is two mana of any type
          plus tapping the permanent that has the ability.</p>

        <p>602.1b Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while
          activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a
          player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of
          the abilityâs effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they
          appear last, after the abilityâs effect.</p>

        <p>602.1c An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to
          activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.</p>

        <p>602.1d Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as âplayingâ that
          ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now
          refer to âactivatingâ that ability.</p>

        <p>602.2. To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually
          resolve and have its effect. Only an objectâs controller (or its owner, if it doesnât have a controller) can
          activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows
          the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to
          comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability
          started to be activated (see rule 723, âHandling Illegal Actionsâ). Announcements and payments canât be
          altered after theyâve been made.</p>

        <p>602.2a The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated
          from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed. That ability is created on the stack as an
          object thatâs not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that
          created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability
          remains on the stack until itâs countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>602.2b The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell
          listed in rules 601.2bâi. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An
          activated abilityâs analog to a spellâs mana cost (as referenced in rule 601.2f) is its activation cost.</p>

        <p>602.3. Some abilities specify that one of their controllerâs opponents does something the controller would
          normally do while itâs being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent
          does so when the abilityâs controller normally would do so.</p>

        <p>602.3a If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the abilityâs controller decides
          which of those opponents will make the choice.</p>

        <p>602.3b If the ability instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the
          ability is being activated, the abilityâs controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception
          to rule 101.4.</p>

        <p>602.4. Activating an ability that alters costs wonât affect spells and abilities that are already on the
          stack.</p>

        <p>602.5. A player canât begin to activate an ability thatâs prohibited from being activated.</p>

        <p>602.5a A creatureâs activated ability with the tap symbol ({T}) or the untap symbol ({Q}) in its activation
          cost canât be activated unless the creature has been under its controllerâs control since the start of their
          most recent turn. Ignore this rule for creatures with haste (see rule 702.10).</p>

        <p>602.5b If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, âActivate this ability only once
          each turnâ), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.</p>

        <p>602.5c If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on its use from another object, that
          restriction applies only to that ability as acquired from that object. It doesnât apply to other, identically
          worded abilities.</p>

        <p>602.5d Activated abilities that read âActivate this ability only any time you could cast a sorceryâ mean the
          player must follow the timing rules for casting a sorcery spell, though the ability isnât actually a sorcery.
          The player doesnât actually need to have a sorcery card that they could cast.</p>

        <p>602.5e Activated abilities that read âActivate this ability only any time you could cast an instantâ mean the
          player must follow the timing rules for casting an instant spell, though the ability isnât actually an
          instant. The player doesnât actually need to have an instant card that they could cast.</p>

        <h2 id="603">
          603. Handling Triggered Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>603.1. Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as â[When/Whenever/At]
          [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]â</p>

        <p>603.1a A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target
          or state that it canât be countered. This text is not part of the abilityâs effect. It functions while the
          ability is on the stack.</p>

        <p>603.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered abilityâs trigger event, that ability
          automatically triggers. The ability doesnât do anything at this point.</p>

        <p>603.2a Because they arenât cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isnât legal to
          cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated donât affect them.
        </p>

        <p>603.2b When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger âat the beginning ofâ that phase or step
          trigger.</p>

        <p>603.2c An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly
          if one event contains multiple occurrences.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition reads, âWhenever a land is put into a graveyard
          from the battlefield, . . . .â If someone casts a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will trigger once
          for each land put into the graveyard during the spellâs resolution.</p>

        <p>603.2d An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than
          simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that
          ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesnât
          invoke itself repeatedly and doesnât apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers.
        </p>

        <p>603.2e Some trigger events use the word âbecomesâ (for example, âbecomes attachedâ or âbecomes blockedâ).
          These trigger only at the time the named event happensâthey donât trigger if that state already exists or
          retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent âbecomes tappedâ or âbecomes untappedâ
          doesnât trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that triggers when a permanent âbecomes tappedâ triggers only when the status of a
          permanent thatâs already on the battlefield changes from untapped to tapped.</p>

        <p>603.2f If a triggered abilityâs trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no
          time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.</p>

        <p>603.2g An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event thatâs prevented or replaced
          wonât trigger anything.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that triggers on damage being dealt wonât trigger if all the damage is prevented.</p>

        <p>603.3. Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object thatâs not a card the
          next time a player would receive priority. See rule 117, âTiming and Priority.â The ability becomes the
          topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It
          remains on the stack until itâs countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an
          effect moves it elsewhere.</p>

        <p>603.3a A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered,
          unless itâs a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules
          603.7dâf.</p>

        <p>603.3b If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, each player, in
          APNAP order, puts triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule 101.4.)
          Then the game once again checks for and resolves state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities
          that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are
          performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.</p>

        <p>603.3c If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on
          the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example),
          that mode canât be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 700.2.)</p>

        <p>603.3d The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process
          for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2câd. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the
          stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability
          illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.</p>

        <p>603.4. A triggered ability may read âWhen/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].â When the
          trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it
          is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves.
          If the condition isnât true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that
          this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the âintervening âifâ clauseâ rule. (The
          word âifâ has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to
          an âifâ that immediately follows a trigger condition.)</p>
        <p>Example: Felidar Sovereign reads, âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 40 or more life, you win the
          game.â Its controllerâs life total is checked as that playerâs upkeep begins. If that player has 39 or less
          life, the ability doesnât trigger at all. If that player has 40 or more life, the ability triggers and goes on
          the stack. As the ability resolves, that playerâs life total is checked again. If that player has 39 or less
          life at this time, the ability is removed from the stack and has no effect. If that player has 40 or more life
          at this time, the ability resolves and that player wins the game.</p>

        <p>603.5. Some triggered abilitiesâ effects are optional (they contain âmay,â as in âAt the beginning of your
          upkeep, you may draw a cardâ). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their
          controller intends to exercise the abilityâs option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves.
          Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect âunlessâ something is true or a player chooses to do
          something will go on the stack normally; the âunlessâ part of the ability is dealt with when the ability
          resolves.</p>

        <p>603.6. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called âzone-change triggers.â Many abilities
          with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution,
          these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the
          zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything.
          The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it
          left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a
          library or an opponentâs hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before
          the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and
          leaves-the-battlefield triggers.</p>

        <p>603.6a Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written,
          âWhen [this object] enters the battlefield, . . . â or âWhenever a [type] enters the battlefield, . . .â Each
          time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including
          the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.</p>

        <p>603.6b Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the
          battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified
          characteristics. Continuous effects donât apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule
          603.6d).</p>
        <p>Example: If an effect reads âAll lands are creaturesâ and a land card is played, the effect makes the land
          card into a creature the moment it enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a
          creature enters the battlefield. Conversely, if an effect reads âAll creatures lose all abilitiesâ and a
          creature card with an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability enters the battlefield, that effect will cause
          it to lose its abilities the moment it enters the battlefield, so the enters-the-battlefield ability wonât
          trigger.</p>

        <p>603.6c Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone,
          or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but
          arenât limited to, âWhen [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .â or âWhenever [something] is put into a
          graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .â (See also rule 603.10.) An ability that attempts to do something to
          the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that
          triggers when a card is put into a certain zone âfrom anywhereâ is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield
          ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.</p>

        <p>603.6d Some permanents have text that reads â[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,â âAs [this
          permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,â â[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . ,â or â[This
          permanent] enters the battlefield tapped.â Such text is a static abilityânot a triggered abilityâwhose effect
          occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.</p>

        <p>603.6e Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield.
          These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can
          also find the new object the Aura card became in its ownerâs graveyard after state-based actions have been
          checked. See rule 400.7.</p>

        <p>603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed
          triggered ability will contain âwhen,â âwhenever,â or âat,â although that word wonât usually begin the
          ability.</p>

        <p>603.7a Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of
          a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action.
          A delayed triggered ability wonât trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event
          occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.</p>
        <p>Example: Part of an effect reads âWhen this creature leaves the battlefield,â but the creature in question
          leaves the battlefield before the spell or ability creating the effect resolves. In this case, the delayed
          ability never triggers.</p>
        <p>Example: If an effect reads âWhen this creature becomes untappedâ and the named creature becomes untapped
          before the effect resolves, the ability waits for the next time that creature untaps.</p>

        <p>603.7b A delayed triggered ability will trigger only onceâthe next time its trigger event occursâunless it
          has a stated duration, such as âthis turn.â If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the
          ability doesnât have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event
          causes the ability to trigger.</p>

        <p>603.7c A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object
          changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone itâs expected to be in at the time
          the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability wonât affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone
          and then returned, itâs a new object and thus wonât be affected. See rule 400.7.)</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that reads âExile this creature at the beginning of the next end stepâ will exile the
          permanent even if itâs no longer a creature during the next end step. However, it wonât do anything if the
          permanent left the battlefield before then.</p>

        <p>603.7d If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that
          spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it
          resolved.</p>

        <p>603.7e If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed
          triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered
          ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.</p>

        <p>603.7f If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be
          created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller
          of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement
          effect was applied.</p>

        <p>603.7g If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that
          player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The
          controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the
          action was taken.</p>

        <p>603.8. Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a
          particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as
          the game state matches the condition. Theyâll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are
          called state triggers. (Note that state triggers arenât the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered
          ability doesnât trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the
          stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its
          trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanentâs ability reads, âWhenever you have no cards in hand, draw a card.â If its controller
          plays the last card from their hand, the ability will trigger once and wonât trigger again until it has left
          the stack. If its controller casts a spell that reads âDiscard your hand, then draw that many cards,â the
          ability will trigger during the spellâs resolution because the playerâs hand was momentarily empty.</p>

        <p>603.9. Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger
          when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the
          result of a draw. See rule 104.3.</p>

        <p>603.10. Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any
          trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger
          conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are
          exceptions to this rule; the game âlooks back in timeâ to determine if those abilities trigger, using the
          existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of
          exceptions is as follows:</p>

        <p>603.10a Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities
          that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can
          see is put into a hand or library.</p>
        <p>Example: Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that has the ability âWhenever a
          creature dies, you gain 1 life.â Someone casts a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and
          enchantments. The artifactâs ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its ownerâs graveyard at
          the same time as the creatures.</p>

        <p>603.10b Abilities that trigger when a permanent phases out look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10c Abilities that trigger specifically when an object becomes unattached look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10d Abilities that trigger when a player loses control of an object look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10e Abilities that trigger when a spell is countered look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10f Abilities that trigger when a player loses the game look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.10g Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks away from a plane look back in time.</p>

        <p>603.11. Some objects have a static ability thatâs linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule 607,
          âLinked Abilities.â) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first,
          followed by each triggered ability thatâs linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are
          written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability that reads âReveal the first card you draw each turn. Whenever you reveal a basic land
          card this way, draw a cardâ is a static ability linked to a triggered ability.</p>

        <p>603.12. A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered
          ability that triggers âwhen [a player] [does or doesnât]â take that action or âwhen [something happens] this
          way.â These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7),
          except that theyâre checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or
          events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.</p>
        <p>Example: Heart-Piercer Manticore has an ability that reads âWhen Heart-Piercer Manticore enters the
          battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, Heart-Piercer Manticore deals damage equal to
          that creatureâs power to any target.â The reflexive triggered ability triggers only when you sacrifice another
          creature due to the original triggered ability, and not if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.</p>

        <h2 id="604">
          604. Handling Static Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>604.1. Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written
          as statements, and theyâre simply true.</p>

        <p>604.2. Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement
          effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has
          the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule
          113.6.</p>

        <p>604.3. Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys
          information about an objectâs characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as
          in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override
          information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also
          function outside the game.</p>

        <p>604.3a A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets the following criteria: (1) It
          defines an objectâs colors, subtypes, power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was
          granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it
          affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the
          characteristics of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to itself; and (5) it
          does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met.</p>

        <p>604.4. Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object theyâre
          attached to, but those abilities donât target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to
          a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.</p>

        <p>604.5. Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to
          countering the spell. Also, abilities that say âAs an additional cost to cast . . . ,â âYou may pay [cost]
          rather than pay [this object]âs mana cost,â and âYou may cast [this object] without paying its mana costâ work
          while a spell is on the stack.</p>

        <p>604.6. Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually
          your hand). These are limited to those that read, âYou may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,â âYou canât
          [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,â and â[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .â</p>

        <p>604.7. Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities canât use an objectâs last known
          information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.</p>

        <h2 id="605">
          605. Mana Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>605.1. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special
          rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of
          what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as âActivate this ability only any time
          you could cast an instantâ) they may have.</p>

        <p>605.1a An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesnât require a
          target (see rule 115.6), it could add mana to a playerâs mana pool when it resolves, and itâs not a loyalty
          ability. (See rule 606, âLoyalty Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>605.1b A triggered ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesnât require a
          target (see rule 115.6), it triggers from the resolution of an activated mana ability (see rule 605.1a) or
          from mana being added to a playerâs mana pool, and it could add mana to a playerâs mana pool when it resolves.
        </p>

        <p>605.2. A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesnât allow it to produce mana.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent has an ability that reads â{T}: Add {G} for each creature you control.â The ability is
          still a mana ability even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.</p>

        <p>605.3. Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see
          rule 602.2), with the following exceptions:</p>

        <p>605.3a A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting
          a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana
          payment, even if itâs in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability.</p>

        <p>605.3b An activated mana ability doesnât go on the stack, so it canât be targeted, countered, or otherwise
          responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after it is activated. (See rule 405.6c.)</p>

        <p>605.3c Once a player begins to activate a mana ability, that ability canât be activated again until it has
          resolved.</p>

        <p>605.4. Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule 603, âHandling
          Triggered Abilitiesâ), with the following exception:</p>

        <p>605.4a A triggered mana ability doesnât go on the stack, so it canât be targeted, countered, or otherwise
          responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for
          priority.</p>
        <p>Example: An enchantment reads, âWhenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type
          that land produced.â If a player taps lands for mana while casting a spell, the additional mana is added
          immediately and can be used to pay for the spell.</p>

        <p>605.5. Abilities that donât meet the criteria specified in rules 605.1aâb and spells arenât mana abilities.
        </p>

        <p>605.5a An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a playerâs mana pool
          when it resolves. The same is true for a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event
          other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers from activating a mana ability but
          couldnât produce mana. These follow the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.</p>

        <p>605.5b A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a playerâs mana pool when it
          resolves. Itâs cast and resolves just like any other spell. Some older cards were printed with the card type
          âmana sourceâ; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and are now instants.</p>

          606. Loyalty Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>606.1. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to special rules.</p>

        <p>606.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Normally, only
          planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.</p>

        <p>606.3. A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and
          the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty
          ability of that permanent that turn.</p>

        <p>606.4. The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a
          certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the abilityâs cost.</p>

        <p>606.5. A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost canât be activated unless the permanent has at least
          that many loyalty counters on it.</p>

          607. Linked Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>607.1. An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or
          objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If
          so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players
          that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.</p>

        <p>607.1a An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants that ability to that object is
          considered to be âprinted onâ that object for these purposes.</p>

        <p>607.1b An ability printed on either face of a transforming double-faced card (see rule 711) is considered to
          be âprinted onâ that object for these purposes, regardless of which face is up.</p>

        <p>607.1c An ability printed on an object that fulfills both criteria described in rule 607.1 is linked to
          itself.</p>

        <p>607.2. There are different kinds of linked abilities.</p>

        <p>607.2a If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that instructs a player to exile one
          or more cards and an ability printed on it that refers either to âthe exiled cardsâ or to cards âexiled with
          [this object],â these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that
          were put there as a result of an instruction to exile them in the first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2b If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more
          cards to be exiled and an ability printed on it that refers either to âthe exiled cardsâ or to cards âexiled
          with [this object],â these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone
          that were put there as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability. See rule 614,
          âReplacement Effects.â</p>

        <p>607.2c If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that puts one or more objects onto
          the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to objects âput onto the battlefield with [this
          object]â or âcreated with [this object],â those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to objects put
          onto the battlefield as a result of the first.</p>

        <p>607.2d If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to âchoose a [value]â and an ability
          printed on it that refers to âthe chosen [value],â âthe last chosen [value],â or similar, those abilities are
          linked. The second ability refers only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2e If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to choose from between two or more
          words that otherwise have no rules meaning and an ability printed on it that refers to a choice involving one
          or more of those words, those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to a choice made as a result of
          the first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2f If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a cost as it enters the
          battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid âas [this object] entered the
          battlefield,â these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a cost paid as a result of the
          first ability.</p>

        <p>607.2g If an object has both a static ability and one or more triggered abilities printed on it in the same
          paragraph, each of those triggered abilities is linked to the static ability. Each triggered ability refers
          only to actions taken as a result of the static ability. See rule 603.11.</p>

        <p>607.2h If an object has a kicker ability printed on it and an ability printed on it that refers to whether
          that object was kicked, those abilities are linked. The second refers only to whether the intent to pay the
          kicker cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as a spell. If a kicker ability lists
          multiple costs, it will have multiple abilities linked to it. Each of those abilities will specify which
          kicker cost it refers to. See rule 702.32, âKicker.â</p>

        <p>607.2i If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a variable additional cost as
          itâs cast and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid âas [this object] was cast,â these
          abilities are linked. The second refers only to the value chosen for the cost listed in the first as the
          object was cast as a spell. See rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>607.2j The two abilities represented by the champion keyword are linked abilities. See rule 702.71,
          âChampion.â</p>

        <p>607.2k Abilities preceded by an anchor word are linked to the ability that allows a player to choose that
          anchor word. See rule 614.12b.</p>

        <p>607.2m If an object has a static ability printed on it that allows a player to exile one or more cards
          âbefore you shuffle your deck to start the gameâ and an ability printed on it that refers to cards âexiled
          with cards named [this objectâs name],â the second ability is linked to the first ability of any objects that
          had the specified name before the game began.</p>

        <p>607.3. If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as âthe exiled card,â âa
          card exiled with [this card],â or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually
          because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any
          information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or converted mana cost, it gets multiple answers.
          If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that
          ability performs any actions on âtheâ card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability
          performs any actions on âaâ card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.</p>

        <p>607.4. An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.</p>
        <p>Example: Paradise Plume has the following three abilities: âAs Paradise Plume enters the battlefield, choose
          a color,â âWhenever a player casts a spell of the chosen color, you may gain 1 life,â and â{T}: Add one mana
          of the chosen color.â The first and second abilities are linked. The first and third abilities are linked.</p>

        <p>607.5. If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be
          similarly linked to one another on that object even though they werenât printed on that object. They canât be
          linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had
          in the past.</p>
        <p>Example: Arc-Slogger has the ability â{R}, Exile the top ten cards of your library: Arc-Slogger deals 2
          damage to any target.â Sisters of Stone Death has the ability â{B}{G}: Exile target creature blocking or
          blocked by Sisters of Stone Deathâ and the ability â{2}{B}: Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone
          Death onto the battlefield under your control.â Quicksilver Elemental has the ability â{U}: Quicksilver
          Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.â If a player has Quicksilver
          Elemental gain Arc-Sloggerâs ability, activates it, then has Quicksilver Elemental gain Sisters of Stone
          Deathâs abilities, activates the exile ability, and then activates the return-to-the-battlefield ability, only
          the creature card Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Sisters of Stone Deathâs ability can be returned to the
          battlefield. Creature cards Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Arc-Sloggerâs ability canât be returned.</p>

        <p>607.5a If an object gains an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesnât copy that abilityâs
          linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered
          to be âundefined.â If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability wonât do anything.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Voice of All enters the battlefield and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in
          part, âAs Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.â and âVoice of All has protection from the
          chosen color.â Unstable Shapeshifter never had a chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didnât
          enter the battlefield as Voice of All so it doesnât gain a protection ability.</p>
        <p>Example: A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Voice of All, and the Doppelgangerâs
          controller chooses blue. Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves, which has the ability, â{T}: Add one
          mana of the chosen color.â Even though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasnât chosen for the
          ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves. If that mana ability of the Doppelganger is
          activated, it will not produce mana.</p>

        <h2 id="608">
          608. Resolving Spells and Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>608.1. Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves. (See rule
          609, âEffects.â)</p>

        <p>608.2. If the object thatâs resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may
          involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described
          in rules 608.2câj are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The step described in rule 608.2k is
          followed last.</p>

        <p>608.2a If a triggered ability has an intervening âifâ clause, it checks whether the clauseâs condition is
          true. If it isnât, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve.
          See rule 603.4.</p>

        <p>608.2b If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target
          thatâs no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may
          cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have
          changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known
          information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word âtarget,â are now
          illegal, the spell or ability doesnât resolve. Itâs removed from the stack and, if itâs a spell, put into its
          ownerâs graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, wonât be
          affected by parts of a resolving spellâs effect for which theyâre illegal. Other parts of the effect for which
          those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects
          that affect game rules (see rule 613.11), those effects donât apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect
          requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the
          effect that requires that information wonât happen.</p>
        <p>Example: Sorinâs Thirst is a black instant that reads, âSorinâs Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and
          you gain 2 life.â If the creature isnât a legal target during the resolution of Sorinâs Thirst (say, if the
          creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorinâs Thirst doesnât resolve. Its
          controller doesnât gain any life.</p>
        <p>Example: Plague Spores reads, âDestroy target nonblack creature and target land. They canât be regenerated.â
          Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the
          creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the
          black creature land is still a legal target for the âtarget landâ part of the spell. The âdestroy target
          nonblack creatureâ part of the spell wonât affect that permanent, but the âdestroy target landâ part of the
          spell will still destroy it. It canât be regenerated.</p>

        <p>608.2c The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However,
          replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of
          earlier text (for example, âDestroy target creature. It canât be regeneratedâ or âCounter target spell. If
          that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its ownerâs library instead of into its ownerâs
          graveyard.â) Donât just apply effects step by step without thinking in these casesâread the whole text and
          apply the rules of English to the text.</p>

        <p>608.2d If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of
          casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player
          announces these while applying the effect. The player canât choose an option thatâs illegal or impossible,
          with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesnât make drawing a card an impossible action
          (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player
          chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such
          that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect
          divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target
          objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack
          rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.)</p>
        <p>Example: A spellâs instruction reads, âYou may sacrifice a creature. If you donât, you lose 4 life.â A player
          who controls no creatures canât choose the sacrifice option.</p>

        <p>608.2e Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses,
          that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and
          then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP
          order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4.</p>

        <p>608.2f If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking
          that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do
          so by following the steps in rules 601.2aâi, except no player receives priority after itâs cast. That spell
          becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve,
          which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities
          can normally be activated during resolution.</p>

        <p>608.2g If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield),
          the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a
          specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that
          object if itâs in the public zone it was expected to be in; if itâs no longer in that zone, or if the effect
          has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the objectâs last known information. See
          rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, itâs the object as it existsâor as it most
          recently existedâthat does it, not the ability.</p>

        <p>608.2h If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified
          characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that reads âDestroy all black creaturesâ destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that
          reads âDestroy all nonblack creaturesâ doesnât.</p>

        <p>608.2i If an abilityâs effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by
          that abilityâs cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed
          characteristics.</p>
        <p>Example: Wall of Tears says âWhenever Wall of Tears blocks a creature, return that creature to its ownerâs
          hand at end of combat.â If Wall of Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before
          the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to its ownerâs hand.</p>

        <p>608.2j If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it
          starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully.</p>

        <p>608.2k As the final part of an instant or sorcery spellâs resolution, the spell is put into its ownerâs
          graveyard. As the final part of an abilityâs resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to
          exist.</p>

        <p>608.3. If the object thatâs resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution involves a single step (unless
          itâs an Aura or a mutating creature spell). The spell card becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield
          under the control of the spellâs controller.</p>

        <p>608.3a If the object thatâs resolving is an Aura spell, its resolution involves two steps. First, it checks
          whether the target specified by its enchant ability is still legal, as described in rule 608.2b. (See rule
          702.5, âEnchant.â) If so, the spell card becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control
          of the spellâs controller attached to the object it was targeting.</p>

        <p>608.3b If the object thatâs resolving is a copy of a permanent spell, that object becomes a token permanent
          and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spellâs controller. It is no longer a copy of a
          spell. The token put onto the battlefield this way is not âcreatedâ for the purposes of any replacement
          effects or triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.</p>

        <p>608.3c If the object thatâs resolving is a mutating creature spell, its resolution involves two steps. First,
          it checks whether the target creature with the same owner as the spell is still legal. If so, the spell card
          merges with that permanent. Otherwise, it becomes a creature spell and is put onto the battlefield under the
          control of the spellâs controller. (See rule 702.139, âMutate.â)</p>

        <p>608.3d If a permanent spell resolves but its controller canât put it onto the battlefield, that player puts
          it into its ownerâs graveyard.</p>
        <p>Example: Worms of the Earth has the ability âLands canât enter the battlefield.â Clone says âYou may have
          Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.â If a player casts Clone and chooses
          to copy Dryad Arbor (a land creature) while Worms of the Earth is on the battlefield, Clone canât enter the
          battlefield from the stack. Itâs put into its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <h2 id="609">
          609. Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>609.1. An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell,
          activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects.
          Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.</p>

        <p>609.2. Effects apply only to permanents unless the instructionâs text states otherwise or they clearly can
          apply only to objects in one or more other zones.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that changes all lands into creatures wonât alter land cards in playersâ graveyards. But
          an effect that says spells cost more to cast will apply only to spells on the stack, since a spell is always
          on the stack while a player is casting it.</p>

        <p>609.3. If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Example: If a player is holding only one card, an effect that reads âDiscard two cardsâ causes them to
          discard only that card. If an effect moves cards out of the library (as opposed to drawing), it moves as many
          as possible.</p>

        <p>609.4. Some effects state that a player may do something âas thoughâ some condition were true or a creature
          can do something âas thoughâ some condition were true. This applies only to the stated effect. For purposes of
          that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the
          game normally.</p>

        <p>609.4a If two effects state that a player may (or a creature can) do the same thing âas thoughâ different
          conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one âas thoughâ effect satisfies the requirements for
          another âas thoughâ effect, then both effects will apply.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Vedalken Orrery, an artifact that says âYou may cast spells as though they had
          flash.â That player casts Shamanâs Trance, an instant that says, in part, âYou may play lands and cast spells
          from other playersâ graveyards this turn as though those cards were in your graveyard.â The player may cast a
          sorcery with flashback from another playerâs graveyard as though it were in that playerâs graveyard and as
          though it had flash.</p>

        <p>609.4b If an effect allows a player to spend mana âas though it were mana of any [type or color],â this
          affects only how the player may pay a cost. It doesnât change that cost, and it doesnât change what mana was
          actually spent to pay that cost.</p>

        <p>609.5. If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will
          specify what to do in the event of a tie. The Magic game has no default for ties.</p>

        <p>609.6. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rules 614 and 615.</p>

        <p>609.7. Some effects apply to damage from a sourceâfor example, âThe next time a red source of your choice
          would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.â</p>

        <p>609.7a If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on
          the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a replacement or
          prevention effect thatâs waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability thatâs waiting to trigger (even
          if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source
          doesnât need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. The source is chosen when the effect is
          created. If the player chooses a permanent, the effect will apply to the next damage dealt by that permanent,
          regardless of whether itâs combat damage or damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability. If the player
          chooses a permanent spell, the effect will apply to any damage dealt by that spell and any damage dealt by the
          permanent that spell becomes when it resolves.</p>

        <p>609.7b Some effects from resolved spells and abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain
          properties, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the source would deal damage, the
          âshieldâ rechecks the sourceâs properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isnât prevented or
          replaced. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isnât used up.</p>

        <p>609.7c Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For
          these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to
          any sources that arenât on the battlefield that have that property.</p>

          610. One-Shot Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>610.1. A one-shot effect does something just once and doesnât have a duration. Examples include dealing
          damage, destroying a permanent, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another.</p>

        <p>610.2. Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which instructs a player to do something
          later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than as the spell or ability thatâs creating the
          one-shot effect resolves. See rule 603.7.</p>

        <p>610.3. Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones âuntilâ a specified event occurs. A second
          one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the
          object to its previous zone.</p>

        <p>610.3a If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object
          to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but
          after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the object doesnât move.</p>

        <p>610.3b If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change
          zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that
          ability triggered, the object doesnât move.</p>

        <p>610.3c An object returned to the battlefield this way returns under its ownerâs control unless otherwise
          specified.</p>

        <p>610.3d If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events,
          those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.</p>
        <p>Example: Two Banisher Priests have each exiled a card. All creatures are destroyed at the same time by Day of
          Judgment. The two exiled cards are returned to the battlefield at the same time.</p>

        <p>610.4. Some one-shot effects cause a permanent to phase out âuntilâ a specified event occurs. A second
          one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect causes the
          permanent to phase in.</p>

        <p>610.4a A permanent phased out this way doesnât phase in as a result of the turn-based action during a
          playerâs untap step (see rule 502.1). Other effects may cause it to phase in. If a permanent phased out this
          way phases in due to another effect, the second one-shot effect doesnât happen, even if that permanent has
          phased out again.</p>

        <p>610.4b If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the
          permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur
          but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the permanent doesnât phase out.</p>

        <p>610.4c If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to
          phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that
          ability triggered, the permanent doesnât phase out.</p>

        <p>610.4d If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events,
          those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.</p>

        <h2 id="611">
          611. Continuous Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>611.1. A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies control of objects, or affects
          players or the rules of the game, for a fixed or indefinite period.</p>

        <p>611.2. A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.</p>

        <p>611.2a A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the
          spell or ability creating it (such as âuntil end of turnâ). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end
          of the game.</p>

        <p>611.2b Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded âfor
          as long as . . . .â If the âfor as long asâ duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect
          would first be applied, the effect does nothing. It doesnât start and immediately stop again, and it doesnât
          last forever.</p>
        <p>Example: Master Thief has the ability âWhen Master Thief enters the battlefield, gain control of target
          artifact for as long as you control Master Thief.â If you lose control of Master Thief before the ability
          resolves, it does nothing, because its durationâas long as you control Master Thiefâwas over before the effect
          began.</p>

        <p>611.2c If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics
          or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous
          effect begins. After that point, the set wonât change. (Note that this works differently than a continuous
          effect from a static ability.) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that
          doesnât modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so
          it can affect objects that werenât affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect
          has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects and other parts that donât,
          the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that reads âAll white creatures get +1/+1 until end of turnâ gives the bonus to all
          permanents that are white creatures when the spell or ability resolvesâeven if they change color laterâand
          doesnât affect those that enter the battlefield or turn white afterward.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that reads âPrevent all damage creatures would deal this turnâ doesnât modify any objectâs
          characteristics, so itâs modifying the rules of the game. That means the effect will apply even to damage from
          creatures that werenât on the battlefield when the continuous effect began. It also affects damage from
          permanents that become creatures later in the turn.</p>

        <p>611.2d If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the
          value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 608.2g.</p>

        <p>611.2e If a resolving spell or ability both puts a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield and creates a
          continuous effect stating that the permanent âis [characteristic],â that continuous effect applies
          simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. This characteristic is usually a color or a
          creature type. If the continuous effect says the permanent âbecomes [characteristic]â or âgains [an ability],â
          that effect applies after the permanent is on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Example: Arbiter of the Ideal puts an artifact, creature, or land card onto the battlefield and says, in
          part, âThat permanent is an enchantment in addition to its other types.â An ability that triggers whenever an
          enchantment enters the battlefield would trigger. The permanent doesnât enter the battlefield and then become
          an enchantment.</p>

        <p>611.3. A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.</p>

        <p>611.3a A continuous effect generated by a static ability isnât âlocked inâ; it applies at any given moment to
          whatever its text indicates.</p>

        <p>611.3b The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is on the battlefield or the object
          generating it is in the appropriate zone.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent with the static ability âAll white creatures get +1/+1â generates an effect that
          continuously gives +1/+1 to each white creature on the battlefield. If a creature becomes white, it gets this
          bonus; a creature that stops being white loses it.</p>

        <p>611.3c Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent
          entering the battlefield. They donât wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it.
          Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they are applied before determining
          whether the permanent will cause an ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Example: A permanent with the static ability âAll white creatures get +1/+1â is on the battlefield. A
          creature spell that would normally create a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature. The
          creature doesnât enter the battlefield as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.</p>

        <h2 id="612">
          612. Text-Changing Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>612.1. Some continuous effects change an objectâs text. This can apply to any words or symbols printed on
          that object, but generally affects only that objectâs rules text (which appears in its text box) and/or the
          text that appears in its type line. Such an effect is a text-changing effect.</p>

        <p>612.2. A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the correct way (for example, a Magic
          color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a
          creature type). An effect that changes a color word or a subtype canât change a card name, even if that name
          contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or creature
          type.</p>

        <p>612.2a Most spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature types to define both the creature
          types and the names of the tokens. A text-changing effect that affects such a spell or an object with such an
          ability can change these words because theyâre being used as creature types, even though theyâre also being
          used as names.</p>

        <p>612.3. Effects that add or remove abilities donât change the text of the objects they affect, so any
          abilities that are granted to an object canât be modified by text-changing effects that affect that object.
        </p>

        <p>612.4. A tokenâs subtypes and rules text are defined by the spell or ability that created the token. A
          text-changing effect that affects a token can change these characteristics.</p>

        <p>612.5. One card (Volrathâs Shapeshifter) states that an object has the âfull textâ of another object. This
          changes not just the text that appears in the objectâs text box and type line, but also changes the text that
          represents its name, mana cost, color indicator, power, and toughness.</p>

        <p>612.6. One card (Spy Kit) states that an object has âall names of nonlegendary creature cards.â This changes
          the text that represents the objectâs name. That object has the name of each nonlegendary creature card in the
          Oracle card reference. (See rule 108.1.)</p>

        <p>612.7. One card (Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi) creates a continuous effect that sets the name of an object. This
          changes the text that represents the objectâs name. That object loses any names it had and has only the
          specified name.</p>

        <p>612.8. A splice ability changes a spellâs text by adding the rules text of the card with splice to the spell,
          following that spellâs own rules text. It doesnât modify or replace any of that spellâs own text. (See rule
          702.46, âSplice.â)</p>

        <h2 id="613">
          613. Interaction of Continuous Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>613.1. The values of an objectâs characteristics are determined by starting with the actual object. For a
          card, that means the values of the characteristics printed on that card. For a token or a copy of a spell or
          card, that means the values of the characteristics defined by the effect that created it. Then all applicable
          continuous effects are applied in a series of layers in the following order:</p>

        <p>613.1a Layer 1: Rules and effects that modify copiable values are applied.</p>

        <p>613.1b Layer 2: Control-changing effects are applied.</p>

        <p>613.1c Layer 3: Text-changing effects are applied. See rule 612, âText-Changing Effects.â</p>

        <p>613.1d Layer 4: Type-changing effects are applied. These include effects that change an objectâs card type,
          subtype, and/or supertype.</p>

        <p>613.1e Layer 5: Color-changing effects are applied.</p>

        <p>613.1f Layer 6: Ability-adding effects, keyword counters, ability-removing effects, and effects that say an
          object canât have an ability are applied.</p>

        <p>613.1g Layer 7: Power- and/or toughness-changing effects are applied.</p>

        <p>613.2. Within layer 1, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each
          sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which
          effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)</p>

        <p>613.2a Layer 1a: Copiable effects are applied. This includes copy effects (see rule 706, âCopying Objectsâ)
          and changes to an objectâs base characteristics determined by merging an object with a permanent (see rule
          721, âMerging with Permanentsâ). âAs . . . enters the battlefieldâ and âas . . . is turned face upâ abilities
          generate copiable effects if they set power and toughness, even if they also define other characteristics.</p>

        <p>613.2b Layer 1b: Face-down spells and permanents have their characteristics modified as defined in rule
          707.2.</p>

        <p>613.2c After all rules and effects in layer 1 have been applied, the objectâs characteristics are its
          copiable values. (See rule 706.2.)</p>

        <p>613.3. Within layers 2â6, apply effects from characteristic-defining abilities first (see rule 604.3), then
          all other effects in timestamp order (see rule 613.7). Note that dependency may alter the order in which
          effects are applied within a layer. (See rule 613.8.)</p>

        <p>613.4. Within layer 7, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each
          sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order. (See rule 613.7.) Note that dependency may alter the order in
          which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule 613.8.)</p>

        <p>613.4a Layer 7a: Effects from characteristic-defining abilities that define power and/or toughness are
          applied. See rule 604.3.</p>

        <p>613.4b Layer 7b: Effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value are applied. Effects
          that refer to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer.</p>

        <p>613.4c Layer 7c: Effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness (but donât set power and/or
          toughness to a specific number or value) are applied.</p>

        <p>613.4d Layer 7d: Effects that switch a creatureâs power and toughness are applied. Such effects take the
          value of power and apply it to the creatureâs toughness, and take the value of toughness and apply it to the
          creatureâs power.</p>
        <p>Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creatureâs power and
          toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. A new effect gives the creature +5/+0. Its âunswitchedâ power
          and toughness would be 6/4, so its actual power and toughness is 4/6.</p>
        <p>Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creatureâs power and
          toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. If the +0/+1 effect ends before the switch effect ends, the
          creature becomes 3/1.</p>
        <p>Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creatureâs power and
          toughness. Then another effect switches its power and toughness again. The two switches essentially cancel
          each other, and the creature becomes 1/4.</p>

        <p>613.5. The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is continually and
          automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an objectâs characteristics are instantaneous.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Honor of the Pure is an enchantment that reads âWhite creatures you control get +1/+1.â Honor of the
          Pure and a 2/2 black creature are on the battlefield under your control. If an effect then turns the creature
          white (layer 5), it gets +1/+1 from Honor of the Pure (layer 7c), becoming 3/3. If the creatureâs color is
          later changed to red (layer 5), Honor of the Pureâs effect stops applying to it, and it will return to being
          2/2.</p>
        <p>Example: Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is on the battlefield. An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it (layer 7d),
          making it 3/3. A spell targeting it that says âTarget creature gets +4/+4 until end of turnâ resolves (layer
          7c), making it 7/7. An enchantment that says âCreatures you control get +0/+2â enters the battlefield (layer
          7c), making it 7/9. An effect that says âTarget creature becomes 0/1 until end of turnâ is applied to it
          (layer 7b), making it 5/8 (0/1, with +4/+4 from the resolved spell, +0/+2 from the enchantment, and +1/+1 from
          the counter).</p>

        <p>613.6. If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each
          apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue
          to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability
          generating the effect is removed during this process.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that reads âWild Mongrel gets +1/+1 and becomes the color of your choice until end of
          turnâ is both a power- and toughness-changing effect and a color-changing effect. The âbecomes the color of
          your choiceâ part is applied in layer 5, and then the âgets +1/+1â part is applied in layer 7c.</p>
        <p>Example: Act of Treason has an effect that reads âGain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap
          that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.â This is both a control-changing effect and an effect that
          adds an ability to an object. The âgain controlâ part is applied in layer 2, and then the âit gains hasteâ
          part is applied in layer 6.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect that reads âAll noncreature artifacts become 2/2 artifact creatures until end of turnâ is
          both a type-changing effect and a power- and toughness-setting effect. The type-changing effect is applied to
          all noncreature artifacts in layer 4 and the power- and toughness-setting effect is applied to those same
          permanents in layer 7b, even though those permanents arenât noncreature artifacts by then.</p>
        <p>Example: Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is on the battlefield. An effect that says âUntil end of turn, target
          land becomes a 3/3 creature thatâs still a landâ is applied to it (layers 4 and 7b). An effect that says
          âTarget creature gets +1/+1 until end of turnâ is applied to it (layer 7c), making it a 4/4 land creature.
          Then while you have ten creature cards in your graveyard, you activate Svogthosâs ability: âUntil end of turn,
          Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with âThis creatureâs power and
          toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.â Itâs still a land.â (layers 4, 5,
          and 7b). It becomes an 11/11 land creature. If a creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthosâs
          power and toughness will be modified accordingly. If the first effect is applied to it again, it will become a
          4/4 land creature again.</p>

        <p>613.7. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a
          timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.</p>

        <p>613.7a A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static
          ability is on, or the timestamp of the effect that created the ability, whichever is later.</p>

        <p>613.7b A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receives a timestamp at the time
          itâs created.</p>

        <p>613.7c Each counter receives a timestamp as itâs put on an object or player. If that object or player already
          has a counter of that kind on it, each counter of that kind receives a new timestamp identical to that of the
          new counter.</p>

        <p>613.7d An object receives a timestamp at the time it enters a zone.</p>

        <p>613.7e An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new timestamp each time it becomes attached to an
          object or player.</p>

        <p>613.7f A permanent receives a new timestamp each time it turns face up or face down.</p>

        <p>613.7g A transforming double-faced permanent receives a new timestamp each time it transforms.</p>

        <p>613.7h A face-up plane card, phenomenon card, or scheme card receives a timestamp at the time itâs turned
          face up.</p>

        <p>613.7i A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game.</p>

        <p>613.7j A conspiracy card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game. If itâs face down, it receives a
          new timestamp at the time it turns face up.</p>

        <p>613.7k If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as by entering a zone
          simultaneously or becoming attached simultaneously, their relative timestamps are determined in APNAP order
          (see rule 101.4). Objects controlled by the active player (or owned by the active player, if they have no
          controller) have an earlier relative timestamp in the order of that playerâs choice, followed by each other
          player in turn order.</p>

        <p>613.8. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a
          dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.</p>

        <p>613.8a An effect is said to âdepend onâ another if (a) itâs applied in the same layer (and, if applicable,
          sublayer) as the other effect; (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first
          effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from
          a characteristic-defining ability or both effects are from characteristic-defining abilities. Otherwise, the
          effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.</p>

        <p>613.8b An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects
          have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, theyâre applied in
          timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is
          ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.</p>

        <p>613.8c After each effect is applied, the order of remaining effects is reevaluated and may change if an
          effect that has not yet been applied becomes dependent on or independent of one or more other effects that
          have not yet been applied.</p>

        <p>613.9. One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether
          another effect applies or what another effect does.</p>
        <p>Example: Two effects are affecting the same creature: one from an Aura that says âEnchanted creature has
          flyingâ and one from an Aura that says âEnchanted creature loses flying.â Neither of these depends on the
          other, since nothing changes what they affect or what theyâre doing to it. Applying them in timestamp order
          means the one that was generated last âwins.â The same process would be followed, and the same result reached,
          if either of the effects had a duration (such as âTarget creature loses flying until end of turnâ) or came
          from a non-Aura source (such as âAll creatures lose flyingâ).</p>
        <p>Example: One effect reads, âWhite creatures get +1/+1,â and another reads, âEnchanted creature is white.â The
          enchanted creature gets +1/+1 from the first effect, regardless of its previous color.</p>

        <p>613.10. Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects. For example, an effect might give a
          player protection from red. All such effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of
          objectsâ characteristics. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).</p>

        <p>613.11. Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a
          playerâs maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects are applied
          after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect the costs of spells or
          abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule 601.2f. All other such effects are applied in
          timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).</p>

          614. Replacement Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>614.1. Some continuous effects are replacement effects. Like prevention effects (see rule 615), replacement
          effects apply continuously as events happenâthey arenât locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a
          particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They
          act like âshieldsâ around whatever theyâre affecting.</p>

        <p>614.1a Effects that use the word âinsteadâ are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word
          âinsteadâ to indicate what events will be replaced with other events.</p>

        <p>614.1b Effects that use the word âskipâ are replacement effects. These replacement effects use the word
          âskipâ to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing.</p>

        <p>614.1c Effects that read â[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,â âAs [this permanent] enters
          the battlefield . . . ,â or â[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . â are replacement effects.</p>

        <p>614.1d Continuous effects that read â[This permanent] enters the battlefield . . .â or â[Objects] enter the
          battlefield . . .â are replacement effects.</p>

        <p>614.1e Effects that read âAs [this permanent] is turned face up . . . ,â are replacement effects.</p>

        <p>614.2. Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.</p>

        <p>614.3. There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a
          replacement effect. Such effects last until theyâre used up or their duration has expired.</p>

        <p>614.4. Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occursâthey canât âgo back in timeâ and
          change something thatâs already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or
          activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.</p>
        <p>Example: A player can activate an ability to regenerate a creature in response to a spell that would destroy
          it. Once the spell resolves, though, itâs too late to regenerate the creature.</p>

        <p>614.5. A replacement effect doesnât invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event
          or any modified events that may replace that event.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls two permanents, each with an ability that reads âIf a creature you control would
          deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.â A
          creature that normally deals 2 damage will deal 8 damageânot just 4, and not an infinite amount.</p>

        <p>614.6. If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger
          abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that canât be carried out, in which case the
          impossible instruction is simply ignored.</p>

        <p>614.7. If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect
          simply doesnât do anything.</p>

        <p>614.7a If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. Replacement effects that would
          increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or
          player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.</p>

        <p>614.8. Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word âinsteadâ doesnât appear on the card but is
          implicit in the definition of regeneration. âRegenerate [permanent]â means âThe next time [permanent] would be
          destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If itâs an attacking or blocking
          creature, remove it from combat.â Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the
          permanent regenerates. See rule 701.15.</p>

        <p>614.9. Some effects replace damage dealt to one creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt
          to another creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If either creature
          or planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a
          creature or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be
          redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.</p>

        <p>614.10. An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. âSkip
          [something]â is the same as âInstead of doing [something], do nothing.â Once a step, phase, or turn has
          started, it can no longer be skippedâany skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.</p>

        <p>614.10a Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn wonât happen. Anything scheduled for the ânextâ
          occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isnât skipped. If two effects each cause a player
          to skip their next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping
          the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.</p>

        <p>614.10b Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is
          considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.</p>

        <p>614.11. Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because
          there are no cards in the affected playerâs library.</p>

        <p>614.11a If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all actions required by the replacement
          are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence.</p>

        <p>614.11b If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and
          the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that
          replacement effect.</p>

        <p>614.12. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1câd.) Such
          effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset
          of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects
          apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield,
          taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule
          616.1), continuous effects from the permanentâs own static abilities that would apply to it once itâs on the
          battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.</p>
        <p>Example: Voice of All says âAs Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a colorâ and âVoice of All has
          protection from the chosen color.â An effect creates a token thatâs a copy of Voice of All. As that token is
          created, the tokenâs controller chooses a color for it.</p>
        <p>Example: Yixlid Jailer says âCards in graveyards lose all abilities.â Scarwood Treefolk says âScarwood
          Treefolk enters the battlefield tapped.â A Scarwood Treefolk thatâs put onto the battlefield from a graveyard
          enters the battlefield tapped.</p>
        <p>Example: Orb of Dreams is an artifact that says âPermanents enter the battlefield tapped.â It wonât affect
          itself, so Orb of Dreams enters the battlefield untapped.</p>

        <p>614.12a If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that
          choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield.</p>

        <p>614.12b Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the battlefield with its controllerâs choice of
          one of two abilities, each marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point. â[Anchor word] â
          [ability]â means âAs long as [anchor word] was chosen as this permanent entered the battlefield, this
          permanent has [ability].â The abilities preceded by anchor words are each linked to the ability that causes a
          player to choose between them. See rule 607, âLinked Abilities.â</p>

        <p>614.13. An effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield may cause other objects to change
          zones.</p>

        <p>614.13a While applying an effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield, you may have to choose
          a number of objects that will also change zones. You canât choose the object that will become that permanent
          or any other object entering the battlefield at the same time as that object.</p>
        <p>Example: Sutured Ghoul says, in part, âAs Sutured Ghoul enters the battlefield, exile any number of creature
          cards from your graveyard.â If Sutured Ghoul and Runeclaw Bear enter the battlefield from your graveyard at
          the same time, you canât choose to exile either of them when applying Sutured Ghoulâs replacement effect.</p>

        <p>614.13b The same object canât be chosen to change zones more than once when applying replacement effects that
          modify how a single permanent enters the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Example: Jund (a plane card) says, âWhenever a player casts a black, red, or green creature spell, it gains
          devour 5.â A player controls Runeclaw Bear and casts Thunder-Thrash Elder, a red creature spell with devour 3.
          As Thunder-Thrash Elder enters the battlefield, its controller can choose to sacrifice Runeclaw Bear when
          applying the devour 3 effect or when applying the devour 5 effect, but not both. Thunder-Thrash Elder will
          enter the battlefield with zero, three, or five +1/+1 counters, depending on this choice.</p>

        <p>614.14. An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or
          more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to âthe exiled cardsâ or to cards âexiled with
          [this object].â These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put
          there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of
          linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They canât be linked to any other
          ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See
          rule 607, âLinked Abilities.â</p>

        <p>614.15. Some replacement effects are not continuous effects. Rather, they are an effect of a resolving spell
          or ability that replace part or all of that spell or abilityâs own effect(s). Such effects are called
          self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose
          effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability
          word. When applying replacement effects to an event, self-replacement effects are applied before other
          replacement effects.</p>

        <p>614.16. Some replacement effects apply âif an effect would create one or more tokensâ or âif an effect would
          put one or more counters on a permanent.â These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell
          or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or
          prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasnât itself an effect.</p>

        <p>614.17. Some effects state that something canât happen. These effects arenât replacement effects, but follow
          similar rules.</p>

        <p>614.17a âCanâtâ effects must exist before the appropriate event occursâthey canât âgo back in timeâ and
          change something thatâs already happened.</p>

        <p>614.17b If an event canât happen, a player canât choose to pay a cost that includes that event.</p>

        <p>614.17c If an event canât happen, it can only be replaced by a self-replacement effect (see rule 614.15).
          Other replacement and/or prevention effects canât modify or replace it.</p>

        <p>614.17d Some âcanâtâ effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield or whether it can enter the
          battlefield. Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to
          a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which
          âcanâtâ effects apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking
          into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1),
          continuous effects from the permanentâs own static abilities that would apply to it once itâs on the
          battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.</p>

        <h2 id="615">
          615. Prevention Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>615.1. Some continuous effects are prevention effects. Like replacement effects (see rule 614), prevention
          effects apply continuously as events happenâthey arenât locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a
          damage event that would happen and completely or partially prevent the damage that would be dealt. They act
          like âshieldsâ around whatever theyâre affecting.</p>

        <p>615.1a Effects that use the word âpreventâ are prevention effects. Prevention effects use âpreventâ to
          indicate what damage will not be dealt.</p>

        <p>615.2. Many prevention effects apply to damage from a source. See rule 609.7.</p>

        <p>615.3. There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a
          prevention effect. Such effects last until theyâre used up or their duration has expired.</p>

        <p>615.4. Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event occursâthey canât âgo back in timeâ
          and change something thatâs already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast
          or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.
        </p>
        <p>Example: A player can activate an ability that prevents damage in response to a spell that would deal damage.
          Once the spell resolves, though, itâs too late to prevent the damage.</p>

        <p>615.5. Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may refer to the amount of damage
          that was prevented. The prevention takes place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of
          the effect takes place immediately afterward.</p>

        <p>615.6. If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens. A modified event may occur instead,
          which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that canât be
          carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.</p>

        <p>615.7. Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to a specific amount
          of damageâfor example, âPrevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.â These work
          like shields. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the âshieldedâ permanent or player is prevented. Preventing
          1 damage reduces the remaining shield by 1. If damage would be dealt to the shielded permanent or player by
          two or more applicable sources at the same time, the player or the controller of the permanent chooses which
          damage the shield prevents. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normally.
          Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing it doesnât matter.</p>

        <p>615.8. Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to the next time a
          specific source would deal damage. These effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source,
          regardless of how much damage that is. Once an instance of damage from that source has been prevented, any
          subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt by that source are dealt normally.</p>

        <p>615.9. Some effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability prevent damage from a source of a
          playerâs choice with certain properties. When the source would deal damage, the shield rechecks the sourceâs
          properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isnât prevented or replaced and the shield isnât
          used up. See rule 609.7b.</p>

        <p>615.10. Some prevention effects generated by static abilities refer to a specific amount of damageâfor
          example, âIf a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage.â Such an effect prevents only the
          indicated amount of damage in any applicable damage event at any given time. It will apply separately to
          damage from other applicable events that would happen at the same time, or at a different time.</p>
        <p>Example: Daunting Defender says âIf a source would deal damage to a Cleric creature you control, prevent 1 of
          that damage.â Pyroclasm says âPyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.â Pyroclasm will deal 1 damage to each
          Cleric creature controlled by Daunting Defenderâs controller. It will deal 2 damage to each other creature.
        </p>

        <p>615.11. Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of
          untargeted creatures. Such an effect creates a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell
          or ability that generates that effect resolves.</p>
        <p>Example: Wojek Apothecary has an ability that says â{T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to
          target creature and each other creature that shares a color with it this turn.â When the ability resolves, it
          gives the target creature and each other creature on the battlefield that shares a color with it at that time
          a shield preventing the next 1 damage that would be dealt to it. Changing creaturesâ colors after the ability
          resolves doesnât add or remove shields, and creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn donât get
          the shield.</p>

        <p>615.12. Some effects state that damage âcanât be prevented.â If unpreventable damage would be dealt, any
          applicable prevention effects are still applied to it. Those effects wonât prevent any damage, but any
          additional effects they have will take place. Existing damage prevention shields wonât be reduced by damage
          that canât be prevented.</p>

        <p>615.12a A prevention effect is applied to any particular unpreventable damage event just once. It wonât
          invoke itself repeatedly trying to prevent that damage.</p>

        <p>615.13. Some triggered abilities trigger when damage that would be dealt is prevented. Such an ability
          triggers each time a prevention effect is applied to one or more simultaneous damage events and prevents some
          or all of that damage.</p>

          616. Interaction of Replacement and/or Prevention Effects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>616.1. If two or more replacement and/or prevention effects are attempting to modify the way an event affects
          an object or player, the affected objectâs controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected
          player chooses one to apply, following the steps listed below. If two or more players have to make these
          choices at the same time, choices are made in APNAP order (see rule 101.4).</p>

        <p>616.1a If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects are self-replacement effects (see rule 614.15),
          one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule 616.1b.</p>

        <p>616.1b If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would modify under whose control an object would
          enter the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule 616.1c.</p>

        <p>616.1c If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause an object to become a copy of another
          object as it enters the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule 616.1d.</p>

        <p>616.1d Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be chosen.</p>

        <p>616.1e Once the chosen effect has been applied, this process is repeated (taking into account only
          replacement or prevention effects that would now be applicable) until there are no more left to apply.</p>
        <p>Example: Two permanents are on the battlefield. One is an enchantment that reads âIf a card would be put into
          a graveyard from anywhere, instead exile it,â and the other is a creature that reads âIf [this creature] would
          die, instead shuffle it into its ownerâs library.â If the creature is destroyed, its controller decides which
          replacement to apply first; the other does nothing.</p>
        <p>Example: Essence of the Wild reads âCreatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the
          Wild.â A player who controls Essence of the Wild casts Rusted Sentinel, which normally enters the battlefield
          tapped. As it enters the battlefield, the copy effect from Essence of the Wild is applied first. As a result,
          it no longer has the ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped. Rusted Sentinel will enter the
          battlefield as an untapped copy of Essence of the Wild.</p>

        <p>616.1f While following the steps in 616.1aâd, one replacement or prevention effect may apply to an event, and
          another may apply to an event contained within the first event. In this case, the second effect canât be
          chosen until after the first effect has been chosen.</p>
        <p>Example: A player is instructed to create a token thatâs a copy of Voice of All, which has the ability âAs
          Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.â Doubling Season has an ability that reads âIf an effect
          would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.â
          Because entering the battlefield is an event contained within the event of creating a token, the effect of
          Doubling Season must be applied first, and then the effects of the two Voice of All tokens may be applied in
          either order.</p>

        <p>616.2. A replacement or prevention effect can become applicable to an event as the result of another
          replacement or prevention effect that modifies the event.</p>
        <p>Example: One effect reads âIf you would gain life, draw that many cards instead,â and another reads âIf you
          would draw a card, return a card from your graveyard to your hand instead.â Both effects combine (regardless
          of the order they came into existence): Instead of gaining 1 life, the player puts a card from their graveyard
          into their hand.</p>

          700. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>700.1. Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a
          spell or ability. The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event theyâre looking
          for. One âhappeningâ may be treated as a single event by one ability and as multiple events by another.</p>
        <p>Example: If an attacking creature is blocked by two creatures, this is one event for a triggered ability that
          reads âWhenever [this creature] becomes blockedâ but two events for a triggered ability that reads âWhenever
          [this creature] becomes blocked by a creature.â</p>

        <p>700.2. A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options in a bulleted list preceded by instructions
          for a player to choose a number of those options, such as âChoose one â.â Each of those options is a mode.
          Modal cards printed prior to the Khans of TarkirÂ® set didnât use bulleted lists for the modes; these cards
          have received errata in the Oracle card reference so the modes do appear in a bulleted list.</p>

        <p>700.2a The controller of a modal spell or activated ability chooses the mode(s) as part of casting that spell
          or activating that ability. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets,
          for example), that mode canât be chosen. (See rule 601.2b.)</p>

        <p>700.2b The controller of a modal triggered ability chooses the mode(s) as part of putting that ability on the
          stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that
          mode canât be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 603.3c.)</p>

        <p>700.2c If a spell or ability targets one or more targets only if a particular mode is chosen for it, its
          controller will need to choose those targets only if they chose that mode. Otherwise, the spell or ability is
          treated as though it did not have those targets. (See rule 601.2c.)</p>

        <p>700.2d If a player is allowed to choose more than one mode for a modal spell or ability, that player normally
          canât choose the same mode more than once. However, a few modal spells include the instruction âYou may choose
          the same mode more than once.â If a particular mode is chosen multiple times, the spell is treated as if that
          mode appeared that many times in sequence. If that mode requires a target, the same player or object may be
          chosen as the target for each of those modes, or different targets may be chosen.</p>

        <p>700.2e Some spells and abilities specify that a player other than their controller chooses a mode for it. In
          that case, the other player does so when the spell or abilityâs controller normally would do so. If there is
          more than one other player who could make such a choice, the spell or abilityâs controller decides which of
          those players will make the choice.</p>

        <p>700.2f Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. Changing a spell
          or abilityâs target canât change its mode.</p>

        <p>700.2g A copy of a modal spell or ability copies the mode(s) chosen for it. The controller of the copy canât
          choose a different mode. (See rule 706.10.)</p>

        <p>700.3. Some effects cause objects to be temporarily grouped into piles.</p>

        <p>700.3a Each of the affected objects must be put into exactly one of those piles, unless the effect specifies
          otherwise.</p>

        <p>700.3b Each object in a pile is still an individual object. The pile is not an object.</p>

        <p>700.3c Objects grouped into piles donât leave the zone theyâre currently in. If cards in a graveyard are
          split into piles, the order of the graveyard must be maintained.</p>
        <p>Example: Fact or Fiction reads, âReveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards
          into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.â While an opponent is
          separating the revealed cards into piles, theyâre still in their ownerâs library. They donât leave the library
          until theyâre put into their ownerâs hand or graveyard.</p>

        <p>700.3d A pile can contain zero or more objects.</p>

        <p>700.4. The term dies means âis put into a graveyard from the battlefield.â</p>

        <p>700.5. A playerâs devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana
          costs of permanents that player controls. A playerâs devotion to [color 1] and [color 2] is equal to the
          number of mana symbols among the mana costs of permanents that player controls that are [color 1], [color 2],
          or both colors.</p>

        <p>700.6. The term historic refers to an object that has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the
          Saga subtype.</p>

        <p>700.7. If an ability of an object uses a phrase such as âthis [something]â to identify an object, where
          [something] is a characteristic, it is referring to that particular object, even if it isnât the appropriate
          characteristic at the time.</p>
        <p>Example: An ability reads âTarget creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. Destroy that creature at the
          beginning of the next end step.â The ability will destroy the object it gave +2/+2 to even if that object
          isnât a creature at the beginning of the next end step.</p>

        <p>700.8. Some cards refer to the number of creatures in a playerâs party. A playerâs party consists of up to
          one creature that player controls for each of the following four creature types: Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and
          Wizard.</p>

        <p>700.8a The calculation of the number of creatures in a playerâs party is performed automatically by the game
          and results in a number between zero and four. Players donât declare which specific creatures they control are
          in their party.</p>

        <p>700.8b If a creature has multiple creature types for which it could be the party member, it is counted as the
          party member for only one of those types. If there are different ways to count such a creature that results in
          different numbers of creatures in a playerâs party, it is counted in such a way to get the highest result.</p>

        <p>700.8c A player has a full party if there are four creatures in that playerâs party.</p>

        <h2 id="701">
          701. Keyword Actions
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>701.1. Most actions described in a cardâs rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs
          within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These âkeywordsâ are game terms;
          sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings.</p>

        <p>701.2. Activate</p>

        <p>701.2a To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will
          eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an objectâs controller (or its owner, if it doesnât have a
          controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. A player may
          activate an ability if they have priority. See rule 602, âActivating Activated Abilities.â</p>

        <p>701.3. Attach</p>

        <p>701.3a To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player means to take it from where it
          currently is and put it onto that object or player. If something is attached to a permanent on the
          battlefield, itâs customary to place it so that itâs physically touching the permanent. An Aura, Equipment, or
          Fortification canât be attached to an object or player it couldnât enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>701.3b If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player it canât be
          attached to, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification doesnât move. If an effect tries to attach an Aura,
          Equipment, or Fortification to the object or player itâs already attached to, the effect does nothing. If an
          effect tries to attach an object that isnât an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to another object or player,
          the effect does nothing and the first object doesnât move.</p>

        <p>701.3c Attaching an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification on the battlefield to a different object or player
          causes the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to receive a new timestamp.</p>

        <p>701.3d To âunattachâ an Equipment from a creature means to move it away from that creature so the Equipment
          is on the battlefield but is not equipping anything. It should no longer be physically touching any creature.
          If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to an object or player ceases to be attached to it,
          that counts as âbecoming unattached [from that object or player]â; this includes if that Aura, Equipment, or
          Fortification leaves the battlefield, the object leaves the zone it was in, or that player leaves the game.
        </p>

        <p>701.4. Cast</p>

        <p>701.4a To cast a spell is to take it from the zone itâs in (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay
          its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. A player may cast a spell if they have
          priority. See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â</p>

        <p>701.4b To cast a card is to cast it as a spell.</p>

        <p>701.5. Counter</p>

        <p>701.5a To counter a spell or ability means to cancel it, removing it from the stack. It doesnât resolve and
          none of its effects occur. A countered spell is put into its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>701.5b The player who cast a countered spell or activated a countered ability doesnât get a ârefundâ of any
          costs that were paid.</p>

        <p>701.6. Create</p>

        <p>701.6a To create one or more tokens with certain characteristics, put the specified number of tokens with the
          specified characteristics onto the battlefield.</p>

        <p>701.6b If a replacement effect applies to a token being created, that effect applies before considering any
          continuous effects that will modify the characteristics of that token. If a replacement effect applies to a
          token entering the battlefield, that effect applies after considering any continuous effects that will modify
          the characteristics of that token.</p>

        <p>701.6c Previously, an effect that created tokens instructed a player to âput [those tokens] onto the
          battlefield.â Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they
          now âcreateâ those tokens.</p>

        <p>701.7. Destroy</p>

        <p>701.7a To destroy a permanent, move it from the battlefield to its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>701.7b The only ways a permanent can be destroyed are as a result of an effect that uses the word âdestroyâ
          or as a result of the state-based actions that check for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g) or damage from a
          source with deathtouch (see rule 704.5h). If a permanent is put into its ownerâs graveyard for any other
          reason, it hasnât been âdestroyed.â</p>

        <p>701.7c A regeneration effect replaces a destruction event. See rule 701.15, âRegenerate.â</p>

        <p>701.8. Discard</p>

        <p>701.8a To discard a card, move it from its ownerâs hand to that playerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>701.8b By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card allow the affected player to choose which
          card to discard. Some effects, however, require a random discard or allow another player to choose which card
          is discarded.</p>

        <p>701.8c If a card is discarded, but an effect causes it to be put into a hidden zone instead of into its
          ownerâs graveyard without being revealed, all values of that cardâs characteristics are considered to be
          undefined. If a card is discarded this way to pay a cost that specifies a characteristic about the discarded
          card, that cost payment is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the cost was paid (see rule 723,
          âHandling Illegal Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>701.9. Double</p>

        <p>701.9a Doubling a creatureâs power and/or toughness creates a continuous effect. This effect modifies that
          creatureâs power and/or toughness but doesnât set those characteristics to a specific value. See rule 613.4c.
        </p>

        <p>701.9b To double a creatureâs power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is that creatureâs power as the spell
          or ability that doubles its power resolves. Similarly, an effect that doubles a creatureâs toughness gives it
          +0/+X, where X is that creatureâs toughness. Doubling a creatureâs power and toughness gives it +X/+Y, where X
          is its power and Y is its toughness.</p>

        <p>701.9c If a creatureâs power is less than 0 when itâs doubled, doubling that creatureâs power instead means
          that the creature gets -X/-0, where X is the difference between 0 and its power. Similarly, if its toughness
          is less than 0 when doubled, it gets -0/-X. If one characteristicâs value is negative but the other isnât when
          both are doubled, it gets -X/+Y or +X/-Y, as appropriate.</p>

        <p>701.9d To double a playerâs life total, the player gains or loses an amount of life such that their new life
          total is twice its current value.</p>

        <p>701.9e To double the number of a kind of counters on a player or permanent, give that player or permanent as
          many of those counters as that player or permanent already has.</p>

        <p>701.9f To double the amount of a type of mana in a playerâs mana pool, that player adds an amount of mana of
          that type equal to the amount they already have.</p>

        <p>701.10. Exchange</p>

        <p>701.10a A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of
          two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange canât
          be completed, no part of the exchange occurs.</p>
        <p>Example: If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but one of those creatures is
          destroyed before the spell resolves, the spell does nothing to the other creature.</p>

        <p>701.10b When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players,
          each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player.
          If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player, the exchange effect does nothing.
        </p>

        <p>701.10c When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the
          other playerâs previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered
          abilities may trigger on them. A player who canât gain life canât be given a higher life total this way, and a
          player who canât lose life canât be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7â8).</p>

        <p>701.10d Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a
          different zone (for example, exiled cards and cards in a playerâs hand). These spells and abilities work the
          same as other âexchangeâ spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are
          owned by the same player, and they can exchange the cards even if one zone is empty.</p>

        <p>701.10e If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone, and either of them is attached to
          an object, that card stops being attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that object.
        </p>

        <p>701.10f If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty,
          the cards in the zones are still exchanged.</p>

        <p>701.10g A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each
          value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the
          affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may
          modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who canât gain life canât be
          given a higher life total this way, and a player who canât lose life canât be given a lower life total this
          way (see rules 119.7â8). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created
          setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule 613.4b). This rule does not apply to spells and
          abilities that switch a creatureâs power and toughness.</p>

        <p>701.11. Exile</p>

        <p>701.11a To exile an object, move it to the exile zone from wherever it is. See rule 406, âExile.â</p>

        <p>701.12. Fight</p>

        <p>701.12a A spell or ability may instruct a creature to fight another creature or it may instruct two creatures
          to fight each other. Each of those creatures deals damage equal to its power to the other creature.</p>

        <p>701.12b If a creature instructed to fight is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a creature, no
          damage is dealt. If a creature is an illegal target for a resolving spell or ability that instructs it to
          fight, no damage is dealt.</p>

        <p>701.12c If a creature fights itself, it deals damage to itself equal to twice its power.</p>

        <p>701.12d The damage dealt when a creature fights isnât combat damage.</p>

        <p>701.13. Mill</p>

        <p>701.13a For a player to mill a number of cards, that player puts that many cards from the top of their
          library into their graveyard.</p>

        <p>701.13b A player canât mill a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library. If given the
          choice to do so, they canât choose to take that action. If instructed to do so, they mill as many as possible.
          Similarly, the player can't pay a cost that includes milling a number of cards greater than the number of
          cards in their library.</p>

        <p>701.13c An effect that refers to the âmilled cardâ can find that card in the zone it moved to from the
          library, as long as that zone is a public zone.</p>

        <p>701.13d If an ability checks information about a single milled card but more than one card was milled, that
          ability refers to each of the milled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the milled card,
          such as a characteristic or converted mana cost, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to
          determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on
          âtheâ card, it performs that action on each milled card. If that ability performs any actions on âaâ card, the
          controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.</p>

        <p>701.14. Play</p>

        <p>701.14a To play a land means to put it onto the battlefield from the zone itâs in (usually the hand). A
          player may play a land if they have priority, itâs the main phase of their turn, the stack is empty, and they
          havenât played a land this turn. Playing a land is a special action (see rule 116), so it doesnât use the
          stack; it simply happens. Putting a land onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability isnât the
          same as playing a land. See rule 305, âLands.â</p>

        <p>701.14b To play a card means to play that card as a land or to cast that card as a spell, whichever is
          appropriate.</p>

        <p>701.14c Some effects instruct a player to âplayâ with a certain aspect of the game changed, such as âPlay
          with the top card of your library revealed.â âPlayâ in this sense means to play the Magic game.</p>

        <p>701.14d Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as
          âplayingâ that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle
          card reference so they now refer to âcastingâ that spell or that card.</p>

        <p>701.14e Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as âplayingâ that
          ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now
          refer to âactivatingâ that ability.</p>

        <p>701.15. Regenerate</p>

        <p>701.15a If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a permanent, it creates a replacement
          effect that protects the permanent the next time it would be destroyed this turn. In this case, âRegenerate
          [permanent]â means âThe next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked
          on it and tap it. If itâs an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.â</p>

        <p>701.15b If the effect of a static ability regenerates a permanent, it replaces destruction with an alternate
          effect each time that permanent would be destroyed. In this case, âRegenerate [permanent]â means âInstead
          remove all damage marked on [permanent] and tap it. If itâs an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from
          combat.â</p>

        <p>701.15c Neither activating an ability that creates a regeneration shield nor casting a spell that creates a
          regeneration shield is the same as regenerating a permanent. Effects that say that a permanent canât be
          regenerated donât preclude such abilities from being activated or such spells from being cast; rather, they
          cause regeneration shields to not be applied.</p>

        <p>701.16. Reveal</p>

        <p>701.16a To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time. If an effect causes a card to be
          revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is
          relevant to. If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a card, the card remains
          revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until the time it leaves the stack. If revealing a
          card causes a triggered ability to trigger, the card remains revealed until that triggered ability leaves the
          stack. If that ability isnât put onto the stack the next time a player would receive priority, the card ceases
          to be revealed.</p>

        <p>701.16b Revealing a card doesnât cause it to leave the zone itâs in.</p>

        <p>701.16c If cards in a playerâs library are shuffled or otherwise reordered, any revealed cards that are
          reordered stop being revealed and become new objects.</p>

        <p>701.16d Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules
          as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.</p>

        <p>701.17. Sacrifice</p>

        <p>701.17a To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the battlefield directly to its ownerâs
          graveyard. A player canât sacrifice something that isnât a permanent, or something thatâs a permanent they
          donât control. Sacrificing a permanent doesnât destroy it, so regeneration or other effects that replace
          destruction canât affect this action.</p>

        <p>701.18. Scry</p>

        <p>701.18a To âscry Nâ means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them on the
          bottom of your library in any order and the rest on top of your library in any order.</p>

        <p>701.18b If a player is instructed to scry 0, no scry event occurs. Abilities that trigger whenever a player
          scries wonât trigger.</p>

        <p>701.18c If multiple players scry at once, each of those players looks at the top cards of their library at
          the same time. Those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards
          move at the same time.</p>

        <p>701.19. Search</p>

        <p>701.19a To search for a card in a zone, look at all cards in that zone (even if itâs a hidden zone) and find
          a card that matches the given description.</p>

        <p>701.19b If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain
          card type or color, that player isnât required to find some or all of those cards even if theyâre present in
          that zone.</p>
        <p>Example: Splinter says âExile target artifact. Search its controllerâs graveyard, hand, and library for all
          cards with the same name as that artifact and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.â A player
          casts Splinter targeting Howling Mine (an artifact). Howling Mineâs controller has another Howling Mine in her
          graveyard and two more in her library. Splinterâs controller must find the Howling Mine in the graveyard, but
          may choose to find zero, one, or two of the Howling Mines in the library.</p>

        <p>701.19c If a player is instructed to search a hidden zone for cards that match an undefined quality, that
          player may still search that zone but canât find any cards.</p>
        <p>Example: Lobotomy says âTarget player reveals their hand, then you choose a card other than a basic land card
          from it. Search that playerâs graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as the chosen card
          and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.â If the target player has no cards in their hand when
          Lobotomy resolves, the player who cast Lobotomy searches the specified zones but doesnât exile any cards.</p>

        <p>701.19d If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of cards, such as âa cardâ or âthree
          cards,â that player must find that many cards (or as many as possible, if the zone doesnât contain enough
          cards).</p>

        <p>701.19e If the effect that contains the search instruction doesnât also contain instructions to reveal the
          found card(s), then theyâre not revealed.</p>

        <p>701.19f If searching a zone is replaced with searching a portion of that zone, any other instructions that
          refer to searching the zone still apply. Any abilities that trigger on a library being searched will trigger.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Aven Mindcensor says, in part, âIf an opponent would search a library, that player searches the top
          four cards of that library instead.â Veteran Explorer says âWhen Veteran Explorer dies, each player may search
          their library for up to two basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield. Then each player who searched
          their library this way shuffles it.â An opponent who searched the top four cards of their library because of
          Veteran Explorerâs ability would shuffle the entire library.</p>

        <p>701.19g If an effect offers a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards
          found, that player may choose to search even if the additional actions are illegal or impossible.</p>

        <p>701.19h An effect may instruct a player to search a library for one or more cards more than once before
          instructing a player to shuffle that library. This is the same as a single instruction for that player to
          search that library for all those cards. The player searches that library only once.</p>

        <p>701.19i If multiple players search at once, each of those players looks at the appropriate cards at the same
          time, then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) which card to find.</p>

        <p>701.20. Shuffle</p>

        <p>701.20a To shuffle a library or a face-down pile of cards, randomize the cards within it so that no player
          knows their order.</p>

        <p>701.20b Some effects cause a player to search a library for a card or cards, shuffle that library, then put
          the found card or cards in a certain position in that library. Even though the found card or cards never leave
          that library, they arenât included in the shuffle. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are
          shuffled. Abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. See also rule 401, âLibrary.â
        </p>

        <p>701.20c If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that
          library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone theyâre expected to be in or an effect
          causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone.</p>
        <p>Example: Guile says, in part, âWhen Guile is put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its ownerâs
          library.â Itâs put into a graveyard and its ability triggers, then a player exiles it from that graveyard in
          response. When the ability resolves, the library is shuffled.</p>
        <p>Example: Black Sunâs Zenith says, in part, âShuffle Black Sunâs Zenith into its ownerâs library.â Black Sunâs
          Zenith is in a graveyard, has gained flashback (due to Recoup, perhaps), and is cast from that graveyard.
          Black Sunâs Zenith will be exiled, and its ownerâs library will be shuffled.</p>

        <p>701.20d If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a library, that library is
          shuffled even if there are no objects in that set.</p>
        <p>Example: Loaming Shaman says âWhen Loaming Shaman enters the battlefield, target player shuffles any number
          of target cards from their graveyard into their library.â It enters the battlefield, its ability triggers, and
          no cards are targeted. When the ability resolves, the targeted player will still have to shuffle their
          library.</p>

        <p>701.20e If an effect causes a player to shuffle a library containing zero or one cards, abilities that
          trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger.</p>

        <p>701.20f If two or more effects cause a library to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, abilities that
          trigger when that library is shuffled will trigger that many times.</p>

        <p>701.20g If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a library at the same time that an object would be put
          into a certain position in that library, the result is a shuffled library thatâs randomized except that the
          object is in the specified position.</p>
        <p>Example: Darksteel Colossus and Gravebane Zombie are put into a playerâs graveyard from the battlefield at
          the same time. Darksteel Colossus says in part âIf Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from
          anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its ownerâs library instead.â Gravebane Zombie says
          âIf Gravebane Zombie would die, put Gravebane Zombie on top of its ownerâs library instead.â The player
          shuffles Darksteel Colossus into their library and puts Gravebane Zombie on top of that library.</p>

        <p>701.21. Tap and Untap</p>

        <p>701.21a To tap a permanent, turn it sideways from an upright position. Only untapped permanents can be
          tapped.</p>

        <p>701.21b To untap a permanent, rotate it back to the upright position from a sideways position. Only tapped
          permanents can be untapped.</p>

        <p>701.22. Fateseal</p>

        <p>701.22a To âfateseal Nâ means to look at the top N cards of an opponentâs library, then put any number of
          them on the bottom of that library in any order and the rest on top of that library in any order.</p>

        <p>701.23. Clash</p>

        <p>701.23a To clash, a player reveals the top card of their library. That player may then put that card on the
          bottom of their library.</p>

        <p>701.23b âClash with an opponentâ means âChoose an opponent. You and that opponent each clash.â</p>

        <p>701.23c Each clashing player reveals the top card of their library at the same time. Then those players
          decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.</p>

        <p>701.23d A player wins a clash if that player revealed a card with a higher converted mana cost than all other
          cards revealed in that clash.</p>

        <p>701.24. Planeswalk</p>

        <p>701.24a A player may planeswalk only during a Planechase game. Only the planar controller may planeswalk. See
          rule 901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>701.24b To planeswalk is to put each face-up plane card and phenomenon card on the bottom of its ownerâs
          planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up.
        </p>

        <p>701.24c A player may planeswalk as the result of the âplaneswalking abilityâ (see rule 901.8), because the
          owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenonâs
          triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.</p>

        <p>701.24d The plane card thatâs turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card thatâs
          turned face down or that leaves the game is the plane the player planeswalks away from. The same is true with
          respect to phenomena.</p>

        <p>701.25. Set in Motion</p>

        <p>701.25a Only a scheme card may be set in motion, and only during an Archenemy game. Only the archenemy may
          set a scheme card in motion. See rule 312, âSchemes,â and rule 904, âArchenemy.â</p>

        <p>701.25b To set a scheme in motion, move it off the top of your scheme deck if itâs on top of your scheme deck
          and turn it face up if it isnât face up. That scheme is considered to have been set in motion even if neither
          of these actions was performed on it.</p>

        <p>701.25c Schemes may only be set in motion one at a time. If a player is instructed to set multiple schemes in
          motion, that player sets a scheme in motion that many times.</p>

        <p>701.26. Abandon</p>

        <p>701.26a Only a face-up ongoing scheme card may be abandoned, and only during an Archenemy game. See rule 312,
          âSchemes,â and rule 904, âArchenemy.â</p>

        <p>701.26b To abandon a scheme, turn it face down and put it on the bottom of its ownerâs scheme deck.</p>

        <p>701.27. Proliferate</p>

        <p>701.27a To proliferate means to choose any number of permanents and/or players that have a counter, then give
          each one additional counter of each kind that permanent or player already has.</p>

        <p>701.27b In a Two-Headed Giant game, poison counters are shared by the team. If more than one player on a team
          is chosen this way, only one of those players can be given an additional poison counter. The player who
          proliferates chooses which player that is. See rule 810, âTwo-Headed Giant Variant.â</p>

        <p>701.28. Transform</p>

        <p>701.28a To transform a permanent, turn it over so that its other face is up. Only permanents represented by
          transforming double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 711, âDouble-Faced Cards.â)</p>

        <p>701.28b Although transforming a permanent uses the same physical action as turning a permanent face up or
          face down, they are different game actions. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face down wonât
          trigger when that permanent transforms, and so on.</p>

        <p>701.28c If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent that isnât represented by a
          transforming double-faced card, nothing happens.</p>

        <p>701.28d If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would
          transform into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, nothing happens.</p>

        <p>701.28e Some triggered abilities trigger when an object âtransforms intoâ an object with a specified
          characteristic. Such an ability triggers if the object transforms and has the specified characteristic
          immediately after it transforms.</p>

        <p>701.28f If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent that isnât a delayed triggered ability of that
          permanent tries to transform it, the permanent transforms only if it hasnât transformed since the ability was
          put onto the stack. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to transform that permanent, the
          permanent transforms only if it hasnât transformed since that delayed triggered ability was created. In either
          case, if the permanent has already transformed, the instruction to transform is ignored.</p>

        <p>701.29. Detain</p>

        <p>701.29a Certain spells and abilities can detain a permanent. Until the next turn of the controller of that
          spell or ability, that permanent canât attack or block and its activated abilities canât be activated.</p>

        <p>701.30. Populate</p>

        <p>701.30a To populate means to choose a creature token you control and create a token thatâs a copy of that
          creature token.</p>

        <p>701.30b If you control no creature tokens when instructed to populate, you wonât create a token.</p>

        <p>701.31. Monstrosity</p>

        <p>701.31a âMonstrosity Nâ means âIf this permanent isnât monstrous, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes
          monstrous.â</p>

        <p>701.31b Monstrous is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the
          monstrosity action and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become monstrous.
          Once a permanent becomes monstrous, it stays monstrous until it leaves the battlefield. Monstrous is neither
          an ability nor part of the permanentâs copiable values.</p>

        <p>701.31c If a permanentâs ability instructs a player to âmonstrosity X,â other abilities of that permanent may
          also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X as that permanent became
          monstrous.</p>

        <p>701.32. Vote</p>

        <p>701.32a Some spells and abilities instruct players to vote for one choice from a list of options to determine
          some aspect of the effect of that spell or ability. To vote, each player, starting with a specified player and
          proceeding in turn order, chooses one of those choices.</p>

        <p>701.32b The listed choices may be objects, words with no rules meaning that are each connected to a different
          effect, or other variables relevant to the resolution of the spell or ability.</p>

        <p>701.32c If the text of a spell or ability refers to âvoting,â it refers only to an actual vote, not to any
          spell or ability that involves the players making choices or decisions without using the word âvote.â</p>

        <p>701.32d If an effect gives a player multiple votes, those votes all happen at the same time the player would
          otherwise have voted.</p>

        <p>701.33. Bolster</p>

        <p>701.33a âBolster Nâ means âChoose a creature you control with the least toughness or tied for least toughness
          among creatures you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.â</p>

        <p>701.34. Manifest</p>

        <p>701.34a To manifest a card, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no
          name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Put that card onto the battlefield face down. That permanent is a
          manifested permanent as long as it remains face down. The effect defining its characteristics works while the
          card is face down and ends when itâs turned face up.</p>

        <p>701.34b Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a
          special action that doesnât use the stack (see rule 116.2b). To do this, show all players that the card
          representing that permanent is a creature card and what that cardâs mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the
          permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its
          normal characteristics. (If the card representing that permanent isnât a creature card or it doesnât have a
          mana cost, it canât be turned face up this way.)</p>

        <p>701.34c If a card with morph is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the
          procedure described in rule 702.36e to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up or the procedure
          described above to turn a manifested permanent face up.</p>

        <p>701.34d If an effect instructs a player to manifest multiple cards from their library, those cards are
          manifested one at a time.</p>

        <p>701.34e If an effect instructs a player to manifest a card and a rule or effect prohibits the face-down
          object from entering the battlefield, that card isnât manifested. Its characteristics remain unmodified and it
          remains in its previous zone. If it was face up, it remains face up.</p>

        <p>701.34f If a manifested permanent thatâs represented by an instant or sorcery card would turn face up, its
          controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up
          wonât trigger.</p>

        <p>701.34g See rule 707, âFace-Down Spells and Permanents,â for more information.</p>

        <p>701.35. Support</p>

        <p>701.35a âSupport Nâ on a permanent means âPut a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N other target creatures.â
          âSupport Nâ on an instant or sorcery spell means âPut a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N target creatures.â
        </p>

        <p>701.36. Investigate</p>

        <p>701.36a âInvestigateâ means âCreate a colorless Clue artifact token with â{2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw
          a card.ââ</p>

        <p>701.37. Meld</p>

        <p>701.37a Meld is a keyword action that appears in an ability on one card in a meld pair. (See rule 712, âMeld
          Cards.â) To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and
          combined. The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.</p>

        <p>701.37b Only two cards belonging to the same meld pair can be melded. Tokens, cards that arenât meld cards,
          or meld cards that donât form a meld pair canât be melded.</p>

        <p>701.37c If an effect instructs a player to meld objects that canât be melded, they stay in their current
          zone.</p>
        <p>Example: A player owns and controls Midnight Scavengers and a token thatâs a copy of Graf Rats. At the
          beginning of combat, both are exiled but canât be melded. Midnight Scavengers remains exiled and the exiled
          token ceases to exist.</p>

        <p>701.38. Goad</p>

        <p>701.38a Certain spells and abilities can goad a creature. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell
          or ability, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than that player if able.</p>

        <p>701.38b A static ability may state that a creature âis goaded.â That creature attacks each combat if able and
          attacks a player other than the controller of the permanent with that static ability if able.</p>

        <p>701.38c Once a player has goaded a creature, the same player goading it again has no effect. It doesnât
          create additional combat requirements.</p>

        <p>701.39. Exert</p>

        <p>701.39a To exert a permanent, you choose to have it not untap during your next untap step.</p>

        <p>701.39b A permanent can be exerted even if itâs not tapped or has already been exerted in a turn. If you
          exert a permanent more than once before your next untap step, each effect causing it not to untap expires
          during the same untap step.</p>

        <p>701.39c An object that isnât on the battlefield canât be exerted.</p>

        <p>701.39d âYou may exert [this creature] as it attacksâ is an optional cost to attack (see rule 508.1g). Some
          objects with this static ability have a triggered ability that triggers âwhen you doâ printed in the same
          paragraph. These abilities are linked. (See rule 607.2g.)</p>

        <p>701.40. Explore</p>

        <p>701.40a Certain abilities instruct a permanent to explore. To do so, that permanentâs controller reveals the
          top card of their library. If a land card is revealed this way, that player puts that card into their hand.
          Otherwise, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the exploring permanent and may put the revealed card into
          their graveyard.</p>

        <p>701.40b A permanent âexploresâ after the process described in rule 701.40a is complete, even if some or all
          of those actions were impossible.</p>

        <p>701.40c If a permanent changes zones before an effect causes it to explore, its last known information is
          used to determine which object explored and who controlled it.</p>

        <p>701.41. Assemble</p>

        <p>701.41a Assemble is a keyword action in the Unstable set that puts Contraptions onto the battlefield. Outside
          of silver-bordered cards, only one card (Steamflogger Boss) refers to assembling a Contraption. Cards and
          mechanics from the Unstable set arenât included in these rules. See the Unstable FAQ for more information.</p>

        <p>701.42. Surveil</p>

        <p>701.42a To âsurveil Nâ means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them into
          your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.</p>

        <p>701.42b If an effect allows you to look at additional cards while you surveil, those cards are included among
          the cards you may put into your graveyard and on top of your library in any order.</p>

        <p>701.43. Adapt</p>

        <p>701.43a âAdapt Nâ means âIf this permanent has no +1/+1 counters on it, put N +1/+1 counters on it.â</p>

        <p>701.44. Amass</p>

        <p>701.44a To amass N means âIf you donât control an Army creature, create a 0/0 black Zombie Army creature
          token. Choose an Army creature you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.â</p>

        <p>701.44b The phrase âthe [subtype] you amassedâ refers to the creature you chose, whether or not it received
          counters.</p>

        <h2 id="702">
          702. Keyword Abilities
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>702.1. Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the cardâs rules text. Some, though, are very common
          or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the
          ability as a âkeywordâ; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule.</p>

        <p>702.1a If an effect refers to a â[keyword ability] cost,â it refers only to the variable costs for that
          keyword.</p>
        <p>Example: Varolz, the Scar-Striped has an ability that says âEach creature card in your graveyard has
          scavenge. The scavenge cost is equal to its mana cost.â A creature cardâs scavenge cost is an amount of mana
          equal to its mana cost, and the activation cost of the scavenge ability is that amount of mana plus âExile
          this card from your graveyard.â</p>

        <p>702.1b An effect that grants an object a keyword ability may define a variable in that ability based on
          characteristics of that object or other information about the game state. For these abilities, the value of
          that variable is constantly reevaluated.</p>
        <p>Example: Volcano Hellion has the ability âVolcano Hellion has echo {X}, where X is your life total.â If your
          life total is 10 when Volcano Hellionâs echo ability triggers but 5 when it resolves, the echo cost to pay is
          {5}.</p>
        <p>Example: Fire//Ice is a split card whose halves have the mana costs {1}{R} and {1}{U}. Past in Flames reads
          âEach instant and sorcery card in your graveyard gains flashback until end of turn. The flashback cost is
          equal to its mana cost.â Fire//Ice has âFlashback {2}{U}{R}â while it is in your graveyard, but if you choose
          to cast Fire, the resulting spell has âFlashback {1}{R}.â</p>

        <p>702.1c An effect may state that âthe same is true forâ a list of keyword abilities or similar. If one of
          those keyword abilities has variants or variables and the effect grants that keyword or counters of that
          keyword to one or more objects and/or players, it grants each appropriate variant and variable of that
          keyword.</p>
        <p>Example: Concerted Effort is an enchantment that reads âAt the beginning of each upkeep, creatures you
          control gain flying until end of turn if a creature you control has flying. The same is true for fear, first
          strike, double strike, landwalk, protection, trample, and vigilance.â As that triggered ability resolves, each
          landwalk and protection ability from among creatures you control is granted to each creature you control.</p>

        <p>702.1d An effect may refer to an object âwith [keyword ability]â or âthat has [keyword ability].â This means
          the same thing as an object âwith a [keyword ability] abilityâ or an object âthat has a [keyword ability]
          ability.â</p>

        <p>702.2. Deathtouch</p>

        <p>702.2a Deathtouch is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.2b A creature with toughness greater than 0 thatâs been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since
          the last time state-based actions were checked is destroyed as a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>702.2c Any nonzero amount of combat damage assigned to a creature by a source with deathtouch is considered
          to be lethal damage for the purposes of determining if a proposed combat damage assignment is valid,
          regardless of that creatureâs toughness. See rules 510.1câd.</p>

        <p>702.2d The deathtouch rules function no matter what zone an object with deathtouch deals damage from.</p>

        <p>702.2e If an object changes zones before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is
          used to determine whether it had deathtouch.</p>

        <p>702.2f Multiple instances of deathtouch on the same object are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.3. Defender</p>

        <p>702.3a Defender is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.3b A creature with defender canât attack.</p>

        <p>702.3c Multiple instances of defender on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.4. Double Strike</p>

        <p>702.4a Double strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510,
          âCombat Damage Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.4b If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike as
          the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first
          strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a
          second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining
          attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began,
          as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase
          proceeds to the end of combat step.</p>

        <p>702.4c Removing double strike from a creature during the first combat damage step will stop it from assigning
          combat damage in the second combat damage step.</p>

        <p>702.4d Giving double strike to a creature with first strike after it has already dealt combat damage in the
          first combat damage step will allow the creature to assign combat damage in the second combat damage step.</p>

        <p>702.4e Multiple instances of double strike on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.5. Enchant</p>

        <p>702.5a Enchant is a static ability, written âEnchant [object or player].â The enchant ability restricts what
          an Aura spell can target and what an Aura can enchant.</p>

        <p>702.5b For more information about Auras, see rule 303, âEnchantments.â</p>

        <p>702.5c If an Aura has multiple instances of enchant, all of them apply. The Auraâs target must follow the
          restrictions from all the instances of enchant. The Aura can enchant only objects or players that match all of
          its enchant abilities.</p>

        <p>702.5d Auras that can enchant a player can target and be attached to players. Such Auras canât target
          permanents and canât be attached to permanents.</p>

        <p>702.6. Equip</p>

        <p>702.6a Equip is an activated ability of Equipment cards. âEquip [cost]â means â[Cost]: Attach this permanent
          to target creature you control. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.6b For more information about Equipment, see rule 301, âArtifacts.â</p>

        <p>702.6c âEquip [quality] creatureâ is a variant of the equip ability. âEquip [quality] [cost]â means â[Cost]:
          Attach this permanent to target [quality] creature you control. Activate this ability only any time you could
          cast a sorcery.â This ability doesnât restrict what the Equipment may be attached to.</p>

        <p>702.6d An âequip [quality] creatureâ ability is an equip ability, and an âequip [quality] creatureâ cost is
          an equip cost. Any effect that modifies how or whether a player may activate an equip ability of an object
          affects âequip [quality] creatureâ abilities of that object. Any effect that increases or reduces an equip
          cost will increase or reduce a âequip [quality] creatureâ cost.</p>

        <p>702.6e If a permanent has multiple equip abilities, any of its equip abilities may be activated.</p>

        <p>702.7. First Strike</p>

        <p>702.7a First strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510,
          âCombat Damage Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.7b If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or double strike (see rule 702.4) as
          the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first
          strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a
          second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining
          attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began,
          as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase
          proceeds to the end of combat step.</p>

        <p>702.7c Giving first strike to a creature without it after combat damage has already been dealt in the first
          combat damage step wonât preclude that creature from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step.
          Removing first strike from a creature after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step
          wonât allow it to also assign combat damage in the second combat damage step (unless the creature has double
          strike).</p>

        <p>702.7d Multiple instances of first strike on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.8. Flash</p>

        <p>702.8a Flash is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card itâs on.
          âFlashâ means âYou may play this card any time you could cast an instant.â</p>

        <p>702.8b Multiple instances of flash on the same object are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.9. Flying</p>

        <p>702.9a Flying is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.9b A creature with flying canât be blocked except by creatures with flying and/or reach. A creature with
          flying can block a creature with or without flying. (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step,â and rule 702.17,
          âReach.â)</p>

        <p>702.9c Multiple instances of flying on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.10. Haste</p>

        <p>702.10a Haste is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.10b If a creature has haste, it can attack even if it hasnât been controlled by its controller
          continuously since their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)</p>

        <p>702.10c If a creature has haste, its controller can activate its activated abilities whose cost includes the
          tap symbol or the untap symbol even if that creature hasnât been controlled by that player continuously since
          their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)</p>

        <p>702.10d Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.11. Hexproof</p>

        <p>702.11a Hexproof is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.11b âHexproofâ on a permanent means âThis permanent canât be the target of spells or abilities your
          opponents control.â</p>

        <p>702.11c âHexproofâ on a player means âYou canât be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.â
        </p>

        <p>702.11d âHexproof from [quality]â is a variant of the hexproof ability. âHexproof from [quality]â on a
          permanent means âThis permanent canât be the target of [quality] spells your opponents control or abilities
          your opponents control from [quality] sources.â A âhexproof from [quality]â ability is a hexproof ability.</p>

        <p>702.11e Any effect that causes an object to lose hexproof will cause an object to lose all âhexproof from
          [quality]â abilities. Any effect that allows a player to choose a creature with hexproof as a target as though
          it didnât have hexproof will allow a player to choose a creature with a âhexproof from [quality]â ability. Any
          effect that looks for a card with hexproof will find a card with a âhexproof from [quality]â ability.</p>

        <p>702.11f âHexproof from [quality A] and from [quality B]â is shorthand for âhexproof from [quality A]â and
          âhexproof from [quality B]â; it behaves as two separate hexproof abilities. If an effect causes an object with
          such an ability to lose hexproof from [quality A], for example, that object would still have hexproof from
          [quality B].</p>

        <p>702.11g Multiple instances of the same hexproof ability on the same permanent or player are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.12. Indestructible</p>

        <p>702.12a Indestructible is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.12b A permanent with indestructible canât be destroyed. Such permanents arenât destroyed by lethal
          damage, and they ignore the state-based action that checks for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g).</p>

        <p>702.12c Multiple instances of indestructible on the same permanent are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.13. Intimidate</p>

        <p>702.13a Intimidate is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.13b A creature with intimidate canât be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or creatures that share
          a color with it. (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.13c Multiple instances of intimidate on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.14. Landwalk</p>

        <p>702.14a Landwalk is a generic term that appears within an objectâs rules text as â[type]walk,â where [type]
          is usually a subtype, but can be the card type land, any land type, any supertype, or any combination thereof.
        </p>

        <p>702.14b Landwalk is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.14c A creature with landwalk canât be blocked as long as the defending player controls at least one land
          with the specified subtype (as in âislandwalkâ), with the specified supertype (as in âlegendary landwalkâ),
          without the specified supertype (as in ânonbasic landwalkâ), or with both the specified supertype and the
          specified subtype (as in âsnow swampwalkâ). (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.14d Landwalk abilities donât âcancelâ one another.</p>
        <p>Example: If a player controls a snow Forest, that player canât block an attacking creature with snow
          forestwalk even if they also control a creature with snow forestwalk.</p>

        <p>702.14e Multiple instances of the same kind of landwalk on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.15. Lifelink</p>

        <p>702.15a Lifelink is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.15b Damage dealt by a source with lifelink causes that sourceâs controller, or its owner if it has no
          controller, to gain that much life (in addition to any other results that damage causes). See rule 120.3.</p>

        <p>702.15c If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known
          information is used to determine whether it had lifelink.</p>

        <p>702.15d The lifelink rules function no matter what zone an object with lifelink deals damage from.</p>

        <p>702.15e If multiple sources with lifelink deal damage at the same time, they cause separate life gain events
          (see rules 119.9â10).</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Ajaniâs Pridemate, which reads âWhenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on
          Ajaniâs Pridemate,â and two creatures with lifelink. The creatures with lifelink deal combat damage
          simultaneously. Ajaniâs Pridemateâs ability triggers twice.</p>

        <p>702.15f Multiple instances of lifelink on the same object are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.16. Protection</p>

        <p>702.16a Protection is a static ability, written âProtection from [quality].â This quality is usually a color
          (as in âprotection from blackâ) but can be any characteristic value or information. If the quality happens to
          be a card name, it is treated as such only if the protection ability specifies that the quality is a name. If
          the quality is a card type, subtype, or supertype, the ability applies to sources that are permanents with
          that card type, subtype, or supertype and to any sources not on the battlefield that are of that card type,
          subtype, or supertype. This is an exception to rule 109.2.</p>

        <p>702.16b A permanent or player with protection canât be targeted by spells with the stated quality and canât
          be targeted by abilities from a source with the stated quality.</p>

        <p>702.16c A permanent or player with protection canât be enchanted by Auras that have the stated quality. Such
          Auras attached to the permanent or player with protection will be put into their ownersâ graveyards as a
          state-based action. (See rule 704, âState-Based Actions.â)</p>

        <p>702.16d A permanent with protection canât be equipped by Equipment that have the stated quality or fortified
          by Fortifications that have the stated quality. Such Equipment or Fortifications become unattached from that
          permanent as a state-based action, but remain on the battlefield. (See rule 704, âState-Based Actions.â)</p>

        <p>702.16e Any damage that would be dealt by sources that have the stated quality to a permanent or player with
          protection is prevented.</p>

        <p>702.16f Attacking creatures with protection canât be blocked by creatures that have the stated quality.</p>

        <p>702.16g âProtection from [quality A] and from [quality B]â is shorthand for âprotection from [quality A]â and
          âprotection from [quality B]â; it behaves as two separate protection abilities. If an effect causes an object
          with such an ability to lose protection from [quality A], for example, that object would still have protection
          from [quality B].</p>

        <p>702.16h âProtection from all [characteristic]â is shorthand for âprotection from [quality A],â âprotection
          from [quality B],â and so on for each possible quality the listed characteristic could have; it behaves as
          multiple separate protection abilities. If an effect causes an object with such an ability to lose protection
          from [quality A], for example, that object would still have protection from [quality B], [quality C], and so
          on.</p>

        <p>702.16i âProtection from each [set of characteristics, qualities, or players]â is shorthand for âprotection
          from [A],â âprotection from [B],â and so on for each characteristic, quality, or player in the set. It behaves
          as multiple separate protection abilities.</p>

        <p>702.16j âProtection from everythingâ is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent with protection from
          everything has protection from each object regardless of that objectâs characteristic values. Such a permanent
          canât be targeted by spells or abilities, enchanted by Auras, equipped by Equipment, fortified by
          Fortifications, or blocked by creatures, and all damage that would be dealt to it is prevented.</p>

        <p>702.16k âProtection from [a player]â is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent with protection from
          a specific player has protection from each object the player controls and protection from each object the
          player owns not controlled by another player, regardless of that objectâs characteristic values. Such a
          permanent canât be targeted by spells or abilities the player controls, enchanted by Auras the player
          controls, equipped by Equipment the player controls, fortified by Fortifications the player controls, or
          blocked by creatures the player controls, and all damage that would be dealt to it by sources controlled by
          the player or owned by the player but not controlled by another player is prevented.</p>

        <p>702.16m Multiple instances of protection from the same quality on the same permanent or player are redundant.
        </p>

        <p>702.16n Some Auras both give the enchanted creature protection and say âthis effect doesnât removeâ either
          that specific Aura or all Auras. This means that the specified Auras can legally enchant that creature and
          arenât put into their ownersâ graveyards as a state-based action. If the creature has other instances of
          protection from the same quality, those instances affect Auras as normal.</p>

        <p>702.17. Reach</p>

        <p>702.17a Reach is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.17b A creature with flying canât be blocked except by creatures with flying and/or reach. (See rule 509,
          âDeclare Blockers Step,â and rule 702.9, âFlying.â)</p>

        <p>702.17c Multiple instances of reach on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.18. Shroud</p>

        <p>702.18a Shroud is a static ability. âShroudâ means âThis permanent or player canât be the target of spells or
          abilities.â</p>

        <p>702.18b Multiple instances of shroud on the same permanent or player are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.19. Trample</p>

        <p>702.19a Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking creatureâs combat
          damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage.
          (See rule 510, âCombat Damage Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.19b The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking
          it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its
          controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player or planeswalker the creature is attacking.
          When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage
          from other creatures thatâs being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or
          effects that might change the amount of damage thatâs actually dealt. The attacking creatureâs controller need
          not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case canât assign any damage to the
          player or planeswalker itâs attacking.</p>
        <p>Example: A 2/2 creature that can block an additional creature blocks two attackers: a 1/1 with no abilities
          and a 3/3 with trample. The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker and 1 damage from the
          second to the blocking creature, and 2 damage to the defending player from the creature with trample.</p>
        <p>Example: A 6/6 green creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature with protection from green. The
          attacking creatureâs controller must assign at least 2 damage to the blocker, even though that damage will be
          prevented by the blockerâs protection ability. The attacking creatureâs controller can divide the rest of the
          damage as they choose between the blocking creature and the defending player.</p>

        <p>702.19c If an attacking creature with trample is blocked, but there are no creatures blocking it when damage
          is assigned, all its damage is assigned to the player or planeswalker itâs attacking.</p>

        <p>702.19d If a creature with trample is attacking a planeswalker, none of its combat damage can be assigned to
          the defending player, even if that planeswalker has been removed from combat or the damage the attacking
          creature could assign is greater than the planeswalkerâs loyalty.</p>

        <p>702.19e Multiple instances of trample on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.20. Vigilance</p>

        <p>702.20a Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the declare attackers step.</p>

        <p>702.20b Attacking doesnât cause creatures with vigilance to tap. (See rule 508, âDeclare Attackers Step.â)
        </p>

        <p>702.20c Multiple instances of vigilance on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.21. Banding</p>

        <p>702.21a Banding is a static ability that modifies the rules for combat.</p>

        <p>702.21b âBands with otherâ is a special form of banding. If an effect causes a permanent to lose banding, the
          permanent loses all âbands with otherâ abilities as well.</p>

        <p>702.21c As a player declares attackers, they may declare that one or more attacking creatures with banding
          and up to one attacking creature without banding (even if it has âbands with otherâ) are all in a âband.â They
          may also declare that one or more attacking [quality] creatures with âbands with other [quality]â and any
          number of other attacking [quality] creatures are all in a band. A player may declare as many attacking bands
          as they want, but each creature may be a member of only one of them. (Defending players canât declare bands
          but may use banding in a different way; see rule 702.21j.)</p>

        <p>702.21d All creatures in an attacking band must attack the same player or planeswalker.</p>

        <p>702.21e Once an attacking band has been announced, it lasts for the rest of combat, even if something later
          removes banding or âbands with otherâ from one or more of the creatures in the band.</p>

        <p>702.21f An attacking creature thatâs removed from combat is also removed from the band it was in.</p>

        <p>702.21g Banding doesnât cause attacking creatures to share abilities, nor does it remove any abilities. The
          attacking creatures in a band are separate permanents.</p>

        <p>702.21h If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other creature in the same band as the
          attacking creature becomes blocked by that same blocking creature.</p>
        <p>Example: A player attacks with a band consisting of a creature with flying and a creature with swampwalk. The
          defending player, who controls a Swamp, can block the flying creature if able. If they do, then the creature
          with swampwalk will also become blocked by the blocking creature(s).</p>

        <p>702.21i If one member of a band would become blocked due to an effect, the entire band becomes blocked.</p>

        <p>702.21j During the combat damage step, if an attacking creature is being blocked by a creature with banding,
          or by both a [quality] creature with âbands with other [quality]â and another [quality] creature, the
          defending player (rather than the active player) chooses how the attacking creatureâs damage is assigned. That
          player can divide that creatureâs combat damage as they choose among any creatures blocking it. This is an
          exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1c.</p>

        <p>702.21k During the combat damage step, if a blocking creature is blocking a creature with banding, or both a
          [quality] creature with âbands with other [quality]â and another [quality] creature, the active player (rather
          than the defending player) chooses how the blocking creatureâs damage is assigned. That player can divide that
          creatureâs combat damage as they choose among any creatures itâs blocking. This is an exception to the
          procedure described in rule 510.1d.</p>

        <p>702.21m Multiple instances of banding on the same creature are redundant. Multiple instances of âbands with
          otherâ of the same kind on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.22. Rampage</p>

        <p>702.22a Rampage is a triggered ability. âRampage Nâ means âWhenever this creature becomes blocked, it gets
          +N/+N until end of turn for each creature blocking it beyond the first.â (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers
          Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.22b The rampage bonus is calculated only once per combat, when the triggered ability resolves. Adding or
          removing blockers later in combat wonât change the bonus.</p>

        <p>702.22c If a creature has multiple instances of rampage, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.23. Cumulative Upkeep</p>

        <p>702.23a Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. âCumulative
          upkeep [cost]â means âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent is on the battlefield, put an age
          counter on this permanent. Then you may pay [cost] for each age counter on it. If you donât, sacrifice it.â If
          [cost] has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately for each age counter, then either the
          entire set of costs is paid, or none of them is paid. Partial payments arenât allowed.</p>
        <p>Example: A creature has âCumulative upkeep {W} or {U}â and two age counters on it. When its ability next
          triggers and resolves, the creatureâs controller puts an age counter on it and then may pay {W}{W}{W},
          {W}{W}{U}, {W}{U}{U}, or {U}{U}{U} to keep the creature on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Example: A creature has âCumulative upkeepâSacrifice a creatureâ and one age counter on it. When its ability
          next triggers and resolves, its controller canât choose the same creature to sacrifice twice. Either two
          different creatures must be sacrificed, or the creature with cumulative upkeep must be sacrificed.</p>

        <p>702.23b If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each triggers separately. However, the
          age counters are not connected to any particular ability; each cumulative upkeep ability will count the total
          number of age counters on the permanent at the time that ability resolves.</p>
        <p>Example: A creature has two instances of âCumulative upkeepâPay 1 life.â The creature has no age counters,
          and both cumulative upkeep abilities trigger. When the first ability resolves, the controller adds a counter
          and then chooses to pay 1 life. When the second ability resolves, the controller adds another counter and then
          chooses to pay an additional 2 life.</p>

        <p>702.24. Flanking</p>

        <p>702.24a Flanking is a triggered ability that triggers during the declare blockers step. (See rule 509,
          âDeclare Blockers Step.â) âFlankingâ means âWhenever this creature becomes blocked by a creature without
          flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.â</p>

        <p>702.24b If a creature has multiple instances of flanking, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.25. Phasing</p>

        <p>702.25a Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap step. During each playerâs untap
          step, before the active player untaps permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player controls
          âphase out.â Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had phased out under that playerâs control âphase
          in.â</p>

        <p>702.25b If a permanent phases out, its status changes to âphased out.â Except for rules and effects that
          specifically mention phased-out permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist. It
          canât affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat.
          (See rule 506.4.)</p>
        <p>Example: You control three creatures, one of which is phased out. You cast a spell that says âDraw a card for
          each creature you control.â You draw two cards.</p>
        <p>Example: You control a phased-out creature. You cast a spell that says âDestroy all creatures.â The
          phased-out creature is not destroyed.</p>

        <p>702.25c If a permanent phases in, its status changes to âphased in.â The game once again treats it as though
          it exists.</p>

        <p>702.25d The phasing event doesnât actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though itâs
          treated as though itâs not on the battlefield and not under its controllerâs control while itâs phased out.
          Zone-change triggers donât trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the
          battlefield while phased out. Counters remain on a permanent while itâs phased out. Effects that check a
          phased-in permanentâs history wonât treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter
          the battlefield or its controllerâs control.</p>

        <p>702.25e If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics
          or changes the controller of any objects, a phased-out permanent wonât be included in the set of affected
          objects. This includes continuous effects that reference the permanent specifically, unless they also
          specifically refer to the permanent as phased out.</p>

        <p>702.25f Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out.
          If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once itâs phased in. In particular, effects with âfor as long
          asâ durations that track that permanent (see rule 611.2b) end when that permanent phases out because they can
          no longer see it.</p>

        <p>702.25g When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase
          out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out âindirectly.â An Aura,
          Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly wonât phase in by itself, but instead phases in along
          with the permanent itâs attached to.</p>

        <p>702.25h If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and indirectly, it just phases out indirectly.
        </p>

        <p>702.25i An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will phase in attached to the object or
          player it was attached to when it phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is still
          in the game. If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases in unattached. State-based actions apply as
          appropriate. (See rules 704.5m and 704.5n.)</p>

        <p>702.25j Abilities that trigger when a permanent becomes attached or unattached from an object or player donât
          trigger when that permanent phases in or out.</p>

        <p>702.25k Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also leave the game. This doesnât trigger
          zone-change triggers. See rule 800.4.</p>

        <p>702.25m If an effect causes a player to skip their untap step, the phasing event simply doesnât occur that
          turn.</p>

        <p>702.25n In a multiplayer game, game rules may cause a phased-out permanent to leave the game or to be exiled
          once a player leaves the game. (See rules 800.4a and 800.4c.) If a phased-out permanent phased out under the
          control of a player who has left the game, that permanent phases in during the next untap step after that
          playerâs next turn would have begun.</p>

        <p>702.25p Multiple instances of phasing on the same permanent are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.26. Buyback</p>

        <p>702.26a Buyback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities that function
          while the spell is on the stack. âBuyback [cost]â means âYou may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this
          spellâ and âIf the buyback cost was paid, put this spell into its ownerâs hand instead of into that playerâs
          graveyard as it resolves.â Paying a spellâs buyback cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in
          rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.27. Shadow</p>

        <p>702.27a Shadow is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.27b A creature with shadow canât be blocked by creatures without shadow, and a creature without shadow
          canât be blocked by creatures with shadow. (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.27c Multiple instances of shadow on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.28. Cycling</p>

        <p>702.28a Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card with cycling is in a playerâs
          hand. âCycling [cost]â means â[Cost], Discard this card: Draw a card.â</p>

        <p>702.28b Although the cycling ability can be activated only if the card is in a playerâs hand, it continues to
          exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with cycling will be
          affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.</p>

        <p>702.28c Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when theyâre cycled. âWhen you cycle [this card]â
          means âWhen you discard [this card] to pay an activation cost of a cycling ability.â These abilities trigger
          from whatever zone the card winds up in after itâs cycled.</p>

        <p>702.28d Some cards have abilities that trigger whenever a player âcycles or discardsâ a card. These abilities
          trigger only once when a card is cycled.</p>

        <p>702.28e Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability. â[Type]cycling [cost]â means â[Cost], Discard this
          card: Search your library for a [type] card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.â
          This type is usually a subtype (as in âmountaincyclingâ) but can be any card type, subtype, supertype, or
          combination thereof (as in âbasic landcyclingâ).</p>

        <p>702.28f Typecycling abilities are cycling abilities, and typecycling costs are cycling costs. Any cards that
          trigger when a player cycles a card will trigger when a card is discarded to pay an activation cost of a
          typecycling ability. Any effect that stops players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cardsâ
          typecycling abilities. Any effect that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a
          typecycling cost. Any effect that looks for a card with cycling will find a card with typecycling.</p>

        <p>702.29. Echo</p>

        <p>702.29a Echo is a triggered ability. âEcho [cost]â means âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent
          came under your control since the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay [cost].â</p>

        <p>702.29b Urza block cards with the echo ability were printed without an echo cost. These cards have been given
          errata in the Oracle card reference; each one now has an echo cost equal to its mana cost.</p>

        <p>702.30. Horsemanship</p>

        <p>702.30a Horsemanship is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.30b A creature with horsemanship canât be blocked by creatures without horsemanship. A creature with
          horsemanship can block a creature with or without horsemanship. (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.30c Multiple instances of horsemanship on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.31. Fading</p>

        <p>702.31a Fading is a keyword that represents two abilities. âFading Nâ means âThis permanent enters the
          battlefield with N fade counters on itâ and âAt the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from this
          permanent. If you canât, sacrifice the permanent.â</p>

        <p>702.32. Kicker</p>

        <p>702.32a Kicker is a static ability that functions while the spell with kicker is on the stack. âKicker
          [cost]â means âYou may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell.â Paying a spellâs kicker cost(s)
          follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.32b The phrase âKicker [cost 1] and/or [cost 2]â means the same thing as âKicker [cost 1], kicker [cost
          2].â</p>

        <p>702.32c Multikicker is a variant of the kicker ability. âMultikicker [cost]â means âYou may pay an additional
          [cost] any number of times as you cast this spell.â A multikicker cost is a kicker cost.</p>

        <p>702.32d If a spellâs controller declares the intention to pay any of that spellâs kicker costs, that spell
          has been âkicked.â If a spell has two kicker costs or has multikicker, it may be kicked multiple times. See
          rule 601.2b.</p>

        <p>702.32e Objects with kicker or multikicker have additional abilities that specify what happens if they are
          kicked. These abilities are linked to the kicker or multikicker abilities printed on that object: they can
          refer only to those specific kicker or multikicker abilities. See rule 607, âLinked Abilities.â</p>

        <p>702.32f Objects with more than one kicker cost have abilities that each correspond to a specific kicker cost.
          They contain the phrases âif it was kicked with its [A] kickerâ and âif it was kicked with its [B] kicker,â
          where A and B are the first and second kicker costs listed on the card, respectively. Each of those abilities
          is linked to the appropriate kicker ability.</p>

        <p>702.32g If part of a spellâs ability has its effect only if that spell was kicked, and that part of the
          ability includes any targets, the spellâs controller chooses those targets only if that spell was kicked.
          Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets. See rule 601.2c.</p>

        <p>702.33. Flashback</p>

        <p>702.33a Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that
          functions while the card is in a playerâs graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack.
          âFlashback [cost]â means âYou may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than paying its
          mana costâ and âIf the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time
          it would leave the stack.â Casting a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying
          alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.34. Madness</p>

        <p>702.34a Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions
          while the card with madness is in a playerâs hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the
          first ability is applied. âMadness [cost]â means âIf a player would discard this card, that player discards
          it, but exiles it instead of putting it into their graveyardâ and âWhen this card is exiled this way, its
          owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesnât, they put this
          card into their graveyard.â</p>

        <p>702.34b Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules
          601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.34c After resolving a madness triggered ability, if the exiled card wasnât cast and was moved to a public
          zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that card. See rule 400.7i.</p>

        <p>702.35. Fear</p>

        <p>702.35a Fear is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.35b A creature with fear canât be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures. (See rule
          509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.35c Multiple instances of fear on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.36. Morph</p>

        <p>702.36a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card itâs on, and
          the morph effect works any time the card is face down. âMorph [cost]â means âYou may cast this card as a 2/2
          face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its
          mana cost.â (See rule 707, âFace-Down Spells and Permanents.â)</p>

        <p>702.36b Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. âMegamorph [cost]â means âYou may cast this card as a
          2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying
          its mana costâ and âAs this permanent is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it if its megamorph cost was
          paid to turn it face up.â A megamorph cost is a morph cost.</p>

        <p>702.36c To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card
          with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting
          a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up cardâs characteristics) are applied to casting this
          card. These values are the copiable values of that objectâs characteristics. (See rule 613, âInteraction of
          Continuous Effects,â and rule 706, âCopying Objects.â) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the
          same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying
          alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play
          it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph
          effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.</p>

        <p>702.36d You canât normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.</p>

        <p>702.36e Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face
          up. This is a special action; it doesnât use the stack (see rule 116). To do this, show all players what the
          permanentâs morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the
          permanent wouldnât have a morph cost if it were face up, it canât be turned face up this way.) The morph
          effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering
          the battlefield donât trigger when itâs turned face up and donât have any effect, because the permanent has
          already entered the battlefield.</p>

        <p>702.36f If a permanentâs morph cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The
          value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the morph special action was taken.</p>

        <p>702.36g See rule 707, âFace-Down Spells and Permanents,â for more information about how to cast cards with a
          morph ability.</p>

        <p>702.37. Amplify</p>

        <p>702.37a Amplify is a static ability. âAmplify Nâ means âAs this object enters the battlefield, reveal any
          number of cards from your hand that share a creature type with it. This permanent enters the battlefield with
          N +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way. You canât reveal this card or any other cards that are
          entering the battlefield at the same time as this card.â</p>

        <p>702.37b If a creature has multiple instances of amplify, each one works separately.</p>

        <p>702.38. Provoke</p>

        <p>702.38a Provoke is a triggered ability. âProvokeâ means âWhenever this creature attacks, you may choose to
          have target creature defending player controls block this creature this combat if able. If you do, untap that
          creature.â</p>

        <p>702.38b If a creature has multiple instances of provoke, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.39. Storm</p>

        <p>702.39a Storm is a triggered ability that functions on the stack. âStormâ means âWhen you cast this spell,
          copy it for each other spell that was cast before it this turn. If the spell has any targets, you may choose
          new targets for any of the copies.â</p>

        <p>702.39b If a spell has multiple instances of storm, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.40. Affinity</p>

        <p>702.40a Affinity is a static ability that functions while the spell with affinity is on the stack. âAffinity
          for [text]â means âThis spell costs you {1} less to cast for each [text] you control.â</p>

        <p>702.40b If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each of them applies.</p>

        <p>702.41. Entwine</p>

        <p>702.41a Entwine is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell is on the
          stack. âEntwine [cost]â means âYou may choose all modes of this spell instead of just the number specified. If
          you do, you pay an additional [cost].â Using the entwine ability follows the rules for choosing modes and
          paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.41b If the entwine cost was paid, follow the text of each of the modes in the order written on the card
          when the spell resolves.</p>

        <p>702.42. Modular</p>

        <p>702.42a Modular represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. âModular Nâ means âThis permanent
          enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on itâ and âWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard from the
          battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this
          permanent.â</p>

        <p>702.42b If a creature has multiple instances of modular, each one works separately.</p>

        <p>702.43. Sunburst</p>

        <p>702.43a Sunburst is a static ability that functions as an object is entering the battlefield. âSunburstâ
          means âIf this object is entering the battlefield as a creature, ignoring any type-changing effects that would
          affect it, it enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.
          Otherwise, it enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.â</p>

        <p>702.43b Sunburst adds counters only if the object with sunburst is entering the battlefield from the stack as
          a resolving spell and only if one or more colored mana was spent on its costs, including additional or
          alternative costs.</p>

        <p>702.43c Sunburst can also be used to set a variable number for another ability. If the keyword is used in
          this way, it doesnât matter whether the ability is on a creature spell or on a noncreature spell.</p>
        <p>Example: The ability âModularâSunburstâ means âThis permanent enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on
          it for each color of mana spent to cast itâ and âWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard from the
          battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this
          permanent.â</p>

        <p>702.43d If an object has multiple instances of sunburst, each one works separately.</p>

        <p>702.44. Bushido</p>

        <p>702.44a Bushido is a triggered ability. âBushido Nâ means âWhenever this creature blocks or becomes blocked,
          it gets +N/+N until end of turn.â (See rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.44b If a creature has multiple instances of bushido, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.45. Soulshift</p>

        <p>702.45a Soulshift is a triggered ability. âSoulshift Nâ means âWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard
          from the battlefield, you may return target Spirit card with converted mana cost N or less from your graveyard
          to your hand.â</p>

        <p>702.45b If a permanent has multiple instances of soulshift, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.46. Splice</p>

        <p>702.46a Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your hand. âSplice onto [quality]
          [cost]â means âYou may reveal this card from your hand as you cast a [quality] spell. If you do, that spell
          gains the text of this cardâs rules text and you pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell.â Paying
          a cardâs splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>
        <p>Example: Since the card with splice remains in the playerâs hand, it can later be cast normally or spliced
          onto another spell. It can even be discarded to pay a âdiscard a cardâ cost of the spell itâs spliced onto.
        </p>

        <p>702.46b You canât choose to use a splice ability if you canât make the required choices (targets, etc.) for
          that cardâs rules text. You canât splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If youâre splicing
          more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their effects will
          happen. The effects of the main spell must happen first.</p>

        <p>702.46c The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the rules text of each of the spliced
          cards. This is a text-changing effect (see rule 612, âText-Changing Effectsâ). The spell doesnât gain any
          other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards.
          Text gained by the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from
          which the text was copied.</p>
        <p>Example: Glacial Ray is a red card with splice onto Arcane that reads, âGlacial Ray deals 2 damage to any
          target.â Suppose Glacial Ray is spliced onto Reach Through Mists, a blue spell. The spell is still blue, and
          Reach Through Mists deals the damage. This means that the ability can target a creature with protection from
          red and deal 2 damage to that creature.</p>

        <p>702.46d Choose targets for the added text normally (see rule 601.2c). Note that a spell with one or more
          targets wonât resolve if all of its targets are illegal on resolution.</p>

        <p>702.46e The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack for any reason.</p>

        <p>702.47. Offering</p>

        <p>702.47a Offering is a static ability that functions while the spell with offering is on the stack. â[Subtype]
          offeringâ means âAs an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a [subtype] permanent. If you
          chose to pay the additional cost, this spellâs total cost is reduced by the sacrificed permanentâs mana cost,
          and you may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.â</p>

        <p>702.47b You choose which permanent to sacrifice as you make choices for the spell (see rule 601.2b), and you
          sacrifice that permanent as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).</p>

        <p>702.47c Generic mana in the sacrificed permanentâs mana cost reduces generic mana in the spellâs total cost.
          Colored and colorless mana in the sacrificed permanentâs mana cost reduces mana of the same type in spellâs
          total cost, and any excess reduces that much generic mana in spellâs total cost. (See rule 118.7.)</p>

        <p>702.48. Ninjutsu</p>

        <p>702.48a Ninjutsu is an activated ability that functions only while the card with ninjutsu is in a playerâs
          hand. âNinjutsu [cost]â means â[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand, Return an unblocked attacking creature
          you control to its ownerâs hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped and attacking.â</p>

        <p>702.48b The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability is announced until the ability
          leaves the stack.</p>

        <p>702.48c A ninjutsu ability may be activated only while a creature on the battlefield is unblocked (see rule
          509.1h). The creature with ninjutsu is put onto the battlefield unblocked. It will be attacking the same
          player or planeswalker as the creature that was returned to its ownerâs hand.</p>

        <p>702.48d Commander ninjutsu is a variant of the ninjutsu ability that also functions while the card with
          commander ninjutsu is in the command zone. âCommander ninjutsu [cost]â means â[Cost], Reveal this card from
          your hand or from the command zone, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its ownerâs hand:
          Put this card onto the battlefield tapped and attacking.â</p>

        <p>702.49. Epic</p>

        <p>702.49a Epic represents two spell abilities, one of which creates a delayed triggered ability. âEpicâ means
          âFor the rest of the game, you canât cast spells,â and âAt the beginning of each of your upkeeps for the rest
          of the game, copy this spell except for its epic ability. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new
          targets for the copy.â See rule 706.10.</p>

        <p>702.49b A player canât cast spells once a spell with epic they control resolves, but effects (such as the
          epic ability itself) can still put copies of spells onto the stack.</p>

        <p>702.50. Convoke</p>

        <p>702.50a Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. âConvokeâ
          means âFor each colored mana in this spellâs total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you
          control rather than pay that mana. For each generic mana in this spellâs total cost, you may tap an untapped
          creature you control rather than pay that mana.â</p>

        <p>702.50b The convoke ability isnât an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of
          the spell with convoke is determined.</p>
        <p>Example: Heartless Summoning says, in part, âCreature spells you cast cost {2} less to cast.â You control
          Heartless Summoning and cast Siege Wurm, a spell with convoke that costs {5}{G}{G}. The total cost to cast
          Siege Wurm is {3}{G}{G}. After activating mana abilities, you pay that total cost. You may tap up to two green
          creatures and up to three other creatures to pay that cost, and the remainder is paid with mana.</p>

        <p>702.50c A creature tapped to pay for mana in a spellâs total cost this way is said to have âconvokedâ that
          spell.</p>

        <p>702.50d Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.51. Dredge</p>

        <p>702.51a Dredge is a static ability that functions only while the card with dredge is in a playerâs graveyard.
          âDredge Nâ means âAs long as you have at least N cards in your library, if you would draw a card, you may
          instead mill N cards and return this card from your graveyard to your hand.â</p>

        <p>702.51b A player with fewer cards in their library than the number required by a dredge ability canât mill
          any of them this way.</p>

        <p>702.52. Transmute</p>

        <p>702.52a Transmute is an activated ability that functions only while the card with transmute is in a playerâs
          hand. âTransmute [cost]â means â[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a card with the same
          converted mana cost as the discarded card, reveal that card, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your
          library. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.52b Although the transmute ability can be activated only if the card is in a playerâs hand, it continues
          to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with transmute will
          be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.</p>

        <p>702.53. Bloodthirst</p>

        <p>702.53a Bloodthirst is a static ability. âBloodthirst Nâ means âIf an opponent was dealt damage this turn,
          this permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it.â</p>

        <p>702.53b âBloodthirst Xâ is a special form of bloodthirst. âBloodthirst Xâ means âThis permanent enters the
          battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the total damage your opponents have been dealt this
          turn.â</p>

        <p>702.53c If an object has multiple instances of bloodthirst, each applies separately.</p>

        <p>702.54. Haunt</p>

        <p>702.54a Haunt is a triggered ability. âHauntâ on a permanent means âWhen this permanent is put into a
          graveyard from the battlefield, exile it haunting target creature.â âHauntâ on an instant or sorcery spell
          means âWhen this spell is put into a graveyard during its resolution, exile it haunting target creature.â</p>

        <p>702.54b Cards that are in the exile zone as the result of a haunt ability âhauntâ the creature targeted by
          that ability. The phrase âcreature it hauntsâ refers to the object targeted by the haunt ability, regardless
          of whether or not that object is still a creature.</p>

        <p>702.54c Triggered abilities of cards with haunt that refer to the haunted creature can trigger in the exile
          zone.</p>

        <p>702.55. Replicate</p>

        <p>702.55a Replicate is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions
          while the spell with replicate is on the stack. The second is a triggered ability that functions while the
          spell with replicate is on the stack. âReplicate [cost]â means âAs an additional cost to cast this spell, you
          may pay [cost] any number of timesâ and âWhen you cast this spell, if a replicate cost was paid for it, copy
          it for each time its replicate cost was paid. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for any
          of the copies.â Paying a spellâs replicate cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b
          and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.55b If a spell has multiple instances of replicate, each is paid separately and triggers based on the
          payments made for it, not any other instance of replicate.</p>

        <p>702.56. Forecast</p>

        <p>702.56a A forecast ability is a special kind of activated ability that can be activated only from a playerâs
          hand. Itâs written âForecast â [Activated ability].â</p>

        <p>702.56b A forecast ability may be activated only during the upkeep step of the cardâs owner and only once
          each turn. The controller of the forecast ability reveals the card with that ability from their hand as the
          ability is activated. That player plays with that card revealed in their hand until it leaves the playerâs
          hand or until a step or phase that isnât an upkeep step begins, whichever comes first.</p>

        <p>702.57. Graft</p>

        <p>702.57a Graft represents both a static ability and a triggered ability. âGraft Nâ means âThis permanent
          enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on itâ and âWhenever another creature enters the battlefield, if
          this permanent has a +1/+1 counter on it, you may move a +1/+1 counter from this permanent onto that
          creature.â</p>

        <p>702.57b If a permanent has multiple instances of graft, each one works separately.</p>

        <p>702.58. Recover</p>

        <p>702.58a Recover is a triggered ability that functions only while the card with recover is in a playerâs
          graveyard. âRecover [cost]â means âWhen a creature is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, you may
          pay [cost]. If you do, return this card from your graveyard to your hand. Otherwise, exile this card.â</p>

        <p>702.59. Ripple</p>

        <p>702.59a Ripple is a triggered ability that functions only while the card with ripple is on the stack. âRipple
          Nâ means âWhen you cast this spell, you may reveal the top N cards of your library, or, if there are fewer
          than N cards in your library, you may reveal all the cards in your library. If you reveal cards from your
          library this way, you may cast any of those cards with the same name as this spell without paying their mana
          costs, then put all revealed cards not cast this way on the bottom of your library in any order.â</p>

        <p>702.59b If a spell has multiple instances of ripple, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.60. Split Second</p>

        <p>702.60a Split second is a static ability that functions only while the spell with split second is on the
          stack. âSplit secondâ means âAs long as this spell is on the stack, players canât cast other spells or
          activate abilities that arenât mana abilities.â</p>

        <p>702.60b Players may activate mana abilities and take special actions while a spell with split second is on
          the stack. Triggered abilities trigger and are put on the stack as normal while a spell with split second is
          on the stack.</p>

        <p>702.60c Multiple instances of split second on the same spell are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.61. Suspend</p>

        <p>702.61a Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that functions
          while the card with suspend is in a playerâs hand. The second and third are triggered abilities that function
          in the exile zone. âSuspend Nâ[cost]â means âIf you could begin to cast this card by putting it onto the stack
          from your hand, you may pay [cost] and exile it with N time counters on it. This action doesnât use the
          stack,â and âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended, remove a time counter from it,â and
          âWhen the last time counter is removed from this card, if itâs exiled, play it without paying its mana cost if
          able. If you canât, it remains exiled. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose
          control of the spell or the permanent it becomes.â</p>

        <p>702.61b A card is âsuspendedâ if itâs in the exile zone, has suspend, and has a time counter on it.</p>

        <p>702.61c While determining if you could begin to cast a card with suspend, take into consideration any effects
          that would prohibit that card from being cast.</p>

        <p>702.61d Casting a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in
          rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.62. Vanishing</p>

        <p>702.62a Vanishing is a keyword that represents three abilities. âVanishing Nâ means âThis permanent enters
          the battlefield with N time counters on it,â âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent has a time
          counter on it, remove a time counter from it,â and âWhen the last time counter is removed from this permanent,
          sacrifice it.â</p>

        <p>702.62b Vanishing without a number means âAt the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent has a time
          counter on it, remove a time counter from itâ and âWhen the last time counter is removed from this permanent,
          sacrifice it.â</p>

        <p>702.62c If a permanent has multiple instances of vanishing, each works separately.</p>

        <p>702.63. Absorb</p>

        <p>702.63a Absorb is a static ability. âAbsorb Nâ means âIf a source would deal damage to this creature, prevent
          N of that damage.â</p>

        <p>702.63b Each absorb ability can prevent only N damage from any one source at any one time. It will apply
          separately to damage from other sources, or to damage dealt by the same source at a different time.</p>

        <p>702.63c If an object has multiple instances of absorb, each applies separately.</p>

        <p>702.64. Aura Swap</p>

        <p>702.64a Aura swap is an activated ability of some Aura cards. âAura swap [cost]â means â[Cost]: You may
          exchange this permanent with an Aura card in your hand.â</p>

        <p>702.64b If either half of the exchange canât be completed, the ability has no effect.</p>
        <p>Example: You activate the aura swap ability of an Aura. The only Aura card in your hand canât enchant the
          permanent thatâs enchanted by the Aura with aura swap. The ability has no effect.</p>
        <p>Example: You activate the aura swap ability of an Aura that you control but you donât own. The ability has no
          effect.</p>

        <p>702.65. Delve</p>

        <p>702.65a Delve is a static ability that functions while the spell with delve is on the stack. âDelveâ means
          âFor each generic mana in this spellâs total cost, you may exile a card from your graveyard rather than pay
          that mana.â</p>

        <p>702.65b The delve ability isnât an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of
          the spell with delve is determined.</p>

        <p>702.65c Multiple instances of delve on the same spell are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.66. Fortify</p>

        <p>702.66a Fortify is an activated ability of Fortification cards. âFortify [cost]â means â[Cost]: Attach this
          Fortification to target land you control. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.66b For more information about Fortifications, see rule 301, âArtifacts.â</p>

        <p>702.66c If a Fortification has multiple instances of fortify, any of its fortify abilities may be used.</p>

        <p>702.67. Frenzy</p>

        <p>702.67a Frenzy is a triggered ability. âFrenzy Nâ means âWhenever this creature attacks and isnât blocked, it
          gets +N/+0 until end of turn.â</p>

        <p>702.67b If a creature has multiple instances of frenzy, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.68. Gravestorm</p>

        <p>702.68a Gravestorm is a triggered ability that functions on the stack. âGravestormâ means âWhen you cast this
          spell, copy it for each permanent that was put into a graveyard from the battlefield this turn. If the spell
          has any targets, you may choose new targets for any of the copies.â</p>

        <p>702.68b If a spell has multiple instances of gravestorm, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.69. Poisonous</p>

        <p>702.69a Poisonous is a triggered ability. âPoisonous Nâ means âWhenever this creature deals combat damage to
          a player, that player gets N poison counters.â (For information about poison counters, see rule 104.3d.)</p>

        <p>702.69b If a creature has multiple instances of poisonous, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.70. Transfigure</p>

        <p>702.70a Transfigure is an activated ability. âTransfigure [cost]â means â[Cost], Sacrifice this permanent:
          Search your library for a creature card with the same converted mana cost as this permanent and put it onto
          the battlefield. Then shuffle your library. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.71. Champion</p>

        <p>702.71a Champion represents two triggered abilities. âChampion an [object]â means âWhen this permanent enters
          the battlefield, sacrifice it unless you exile another [object] you controlâ and âWhen this permanent leaves
          the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under its ownerâs control.â</p>

        <p>702.71b The two abilities represented by champion are linked. See rule 607, âLinked Abilities.â</p>

        <p>702.71c A permanent is âchampionedâ by another permanent if the latter exiles the former as the direct result
          of a champion ability.</p>

        <p>702.72. Changeling</p>

        <p>702.72a Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability. âChangelingâ means âThis object is every creature
          type.â This ability works everywhere, even outside the game. See rule 604.3.</p>

        <p>702.73. Evoke</p>

        <p>702.73a Evoke represents two abilities: a static ability that functions in any zone from which the card with
          evoke can be cast and a triggered ability that functions on the battlefield. âEvoke [cost]â means âYou may
          cast this card by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana costâ and âWhen this permanent enters the
          battlefield, if its evoke cost was paid, its controller sacrifices it.â Casting a spell for its evoke cost
          follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.74. Hideaway</p>

        <p>702.74a Hideaway represents a static ability and a triggered ability. âHideawayâ means âThis permanent enters
          the battlefield tappedâ and âWhen this permanent enters the battlefield, look at the top four cards of your
          library. Exile one of them face down and put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order. The exiled
          card gains âAny player who has controlled the permanent that exiled this card may look at this card in the
          exile zone.ââ</p>

        <p>702.75. Prowl</p>

        <p>702.75a Prowl is a static ability that functions on the stack. âProwl [cost]â means âYou may pay [cost]
          rather than pay this spellâs mana cost if a player was dealt combat damage this turn by a source that, at the
          time it dealt that damage, was under your control and had any of this spellâs creature types.â Casting a spell
          for its prowl cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.76. Reinforce</p>

        <p>702.76a Reinforce is an activated ability that functions only while the card with reinforce is in a playerâs
          hand. âReinforce Nâ[cost]â means â[Cost], Discard this card: Put N +1/+1 counters on target creature.â</p>

        <p>702.76b Although the reinforce ability can be activated only if the card is in a playerâs hand, it continues
          to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with reinforce will
          be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.</p>

        <p>702.77. Conspire</p>

        <p>702.77a Conspire is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions
          while the spell with conspire is on the stack. The second is a triggered ability that functions while the
          spell with conspire is on the stack. âConspireâ means âAs an additional cost to cast this spell, you may tap
          two untapped creatures you control that each share a color with itâ and âWhen you cast this spell, if its
          conspire cost was paid, copy it. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy.â
          Paying a spellâs conspire cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.77b If a spell has multiple instances of conspire, each is paid separately and triggers based on its own
          payment, not any other instance of conspire.</p>

        <p>702.78. Persist</p>

        <p>702.78a Persist is a triggered ability. âPersistâ means âWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard from the
          battlefield, if it had no -1/-1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its ownerâs control with a
          -1/-1 counter on it.â</p>

        <p>702.79. Wither</p>

        <p>702.79a Wither is a static ability. Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither isnât marked on that
          creature. Rather, it causes that sourceâs controller to put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature. See
          rule 120.3.</p>

        <p>702.79b If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known
          information is used to determine whether it had wither.</p>

        <p>702.79c The wither rules function no matter what zone an object with wither deals damage from.</p>

        <p>702.79d Multiple instances of wither on the same object are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.80. Retrace</p>

        <p>702.80a Retrace appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents a static ability that functions while
          the card with retrace is in a playerâs graveyard. âRetraceâ means âYou may cast this card from your graveyard
          by discarding a land card as an additional cost to cast it.â Casting a spell using its retrace ability follows
          the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.81. Devour</p>

        <p>702.81a Devour is a static ability. âDevour Nâ means âAs this object enters the battlefield, you may
          sacrifice any number of creatures. This permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it for each
          creature sacrificed this way.â</p>

        <p>702.81b Some objects have abilities that refer to the number of creatures the permanent devoured. âIt
          devouredâ means âsacrificed as a result of its devour ability as it entered the battlefield.â</p>

        <p>702.82. Exalted</p>

        <p>702.82a Exalted is a triggered ability. âExaltedâ means âWhenever a creature you control attacks alone, that
          creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.â</p>

        <p>702.82b A creature âattacks aloneâ if itâs the only creature declared as an attacker in a given combat phase.
          See rule 506.5.</p>

        <p>702.83. Unearth</p>

        <p>702.83a Unearth is an activated ability that functions while the card with unearth is in a graveyard.
          âUnearth [cost]â means â[Cost]: Return this card from your graveyard to the battlefield. It gains haste. Exile
          it at the beginning of the next end step. If it would leave the battlefield, exile it instead of putting it
          anywhere else. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.84. Cascade</p>

        <p>702.84a Cascade is a triggered ability that functions only while the spell with cascade is on the stack.
          âCascadeâ means âWhen you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland
          card whose converted mana cost is less than this spellâs converted mana cost. You may cast that card without
          paying its mana cost. Then put all cards exiled this way that werenât cast on the bottom of your library in a
          random order.â</p>

        <p>702.84b If a spell has multiple instances of cascade, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.85. Annihilator</p>

        <p>702.85a Annihilator is a triggered ability. âAnnihilator Nâ means âWhenever this creature attacks, defending
          player sacrifices N permanents.â</p>

        <p>702.85b If a creature has multiple instances of annihilator, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.86. Level Up</p>

        <p>702.86a Level up is an activated ability. âLevel up [cost]â means â[Cost]: Put a level counter on this
          permanent. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.86b Each card printed with a level up ability is known as a leveler card. It has a nonstandard layout and
          includes two level symbols that are themselves keyword abilities. See rule 710, âLeveler Cards.â</p>

        <p>702.87. Rebound</p>

        <p>702.87a Rebound appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents a static ability that functions while
          the spell is on the stack and may create a delayed triggered ability. âReboundâ means âIf this spell was cast
          from your hand, instead of putting it into your graveyard as it resolves, exile it and, at the beginning of
          your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.â</p>

        <p>702.87b Casting a spell as an effect of its rebound ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in
          rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.87c Multiple instances of rebound on the same spell are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.88. Totem Armor</p>

        <p>702.88a Totem armor is a static ability that appears on some Auras. âTotem armorâ means âIf enchanted
          permanent would be destroyed, instead remove all damage marked on it and destroy this Aura.â</p>

        <p>702.89. Infect</p>

        <p>702.89a Infect is a static ability.</p>

        <p>702.89b Damage dealt to a player by a source with infect doesnât cause that player to lose life. Rather, it
          causes that sourceâs controller to give the player that many poison counters. See rule 120.3.</p>

        <p>702.89c Damage dealt to a creature by a source with infect isnât marked on that creature. Rather, it causes
          that sourceâs controller to put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature. See rule 120.3.</p>

        <p>702.89d If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known
          information is used to determine whether it had infect.</p>

        <p>702.89e The infect rules function no matter what zone an object with infect deals damage from.</p>

        <p>702.89f Multiple instances of infect on the same object are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.90. Battle Cry</p>

        <p>702.90a Battle cry is a triggered ability. âBattle cryâ means âWhenever this creature attacks, each other
          attacking creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn.â</p>

        <p>702.90b If a creature has multiple instances of battle cry, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.91. Living Weapon</p>

        <p>702.91a Living weapon is a triggered ability. âLiving weaponâ means âWhen this Equipment enters the
          battlefield, create a 0/0 black Germ creature token, then attach this Equipment to it.â</p>

        <p>702.92. Undying</p>

        <p>702.92a Undying is a triggered ability. âUndyingâ means âWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard from the
          battlefield, if it had no +1/+1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its ownerâs control with a
          +1/+1 counter on it.â</p>

        <p>702.93. Miracle</p>

        <p>702.93a Miracle is a static ability linked to a triggered ability. (See rule 603.11.) âMiracle [cost]â means
          âYou may reveal this card from your hand as you draw it if itâs the first card youâve drawn this turn. When
          you reveal this card this way, you may cast it by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost.â</p>

        <p>702.93b If a player chooses to reveal a card using its miracle ability, they play with that card revealed
          until that card leaves their hand, that ability resolves, or that ability otherwise leaves the stack. (See
          rule 701.16a.)</p>

        <p>702.94. Soulbond</p>

        <p>702.94a Soulbond is a keyword that represents two triggered abilities. âSoulbondâ means âWhen this creature
          enters the battlefield, if you control both this creature and another creature and both are unpaired, you may
          pair this creature with another unpaired creature you control for as long as both remain creatures on the
          battlefield under your controlâ and âWhenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, if
          you control both that creature and this one and both are unpaired, you may pair that creature with this
          creature for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control.â</p>

        <p>702.94b A creature becomes âpairedâ with another as the result of a soulbond ability. Abilities may refer to
          a paired creature, the creature another creature is paired with, or whether a creature is paired. An
          âunpairedâ creature is one that is not paired.</p>

        <p>702.94c When the soulbond ability resolves, if either object that would be paired is no longer a creature, no
          longer on the battlefield, or no longer under the control of the player who controls the soulbond ability,
          neither object becomes paired.</p>

        <p>702.94d A creature can be paired with only one other creature.</p>

        <p>702.94e A paired creature becomes unpaired if any of the following occur: another player gains control of it
          or the creature itâs paired with; it or the creature itâs paired with stops being a creature; or it or the
          creature itâs paired with leaves the battlefield.</p>

        <p>702.95. Overload</p>

        <p>702.95a Overload is a keyword that represents two static abilities that function while the spell with
          overload is on the stack. Overload [cost] means âYou may choose to pay [cost] rather than pay this spellâs
          mana costâ and âIf you chose to pay this spellâs overload cost, change its text by replacing all instances of
          the word âtargetâ with the word âeach.ââ Casting a spell using its overload ability follows the rules for
          paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.95b If a player chooses to pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell wonât require any targets. It may
          affect objects that couldnât be chosen as legal targets if the spell were cast without its overload cost being
          paid.</p>

        <p>702.95c Overloadâs second ability creates a text-changing effect. See rule 612, âText-Changing Effects.â</p>

        <p>702.96. Scavenge</p>

        <p>702.96a Scavenge is an activated ability that functions only while the card with scavenge is in a graveyard.
          âScavenge [cost]â means â[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to
          the power of the card you exiled on target creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a
          sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.97. Unleash</p>

        <p>702.97a Unleash is a keyword that represents two static abilities. âUnleashâ means âYou may have this
          permanent enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on itâ and âThis permanent canât block as
          long as it has a +1/+1 counter on it.â</p>

        <p>702.98. Cipher</p>

        <p>702.98a Cipher appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities. The first is a spell
          ability that functions while the spell with cipher is on the stack. The second is a static ability that
          functions while the card with cipher is in the exile zone. âCipherâ means âIf this spell is represented by a
          card, you may exile this card encoded on a creature you controlâ and âFor as long as this card is encoded on
          that creature, that creature has âWhenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may copy the
          encoded card and you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.ââ</p>

        <p>702.98b The term âencodedâ describes the relationship between the card with cipher while in the exile zone
          and the creature chosen when the spell represented by that card resolves.</p>

        <p>702.98c The card with cipher remains encoded on the chosen creature as long as the card with cipher remains
          exiled and the creature remains on the battlefield. The card remains encoded on that object even if it changes
          controller or stops being a creature, as long as it remains on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>702.99. Evolve</p>

        <p>702.99a Evolve is a triggered ability. âEvolveâ means âWhenever a creature enters the battlefield under your
          control, if that creatureâs power is greater than this creatureâs power and/or that creatureâs toughness is
          greater than this creatureâs toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.â</p>

        <p>702.99b A creature âevolvesâ when one or more +1/+1 counters are put on it as a result of its evolve ability
          resolving.</p>

        <p>702.99c A creature canât have a greater power or toughness than a noncreature permanent.</p>

        <p>702.99d If a creature has multiple instances of evolve, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.100. Extort</p>

        <p>702.100a Extort is a triggered ability. âExtortâ means âWhenever you cast a spell, you may pay {W/B}. If you
          do, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain life equal to the total life lost this way.â</p>

        <p>702.100b If a permanent has multiple instances of extort, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.101. Fuse</p>

        <p>702.101a Fuse is a static ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, âSplit Cardsâ) that applies while
          the card with fuse is in a playerâs hand. If a player casts a split card with fuse from their hand, the player
          may choose to cast both halves of that split card rather than choose one half. This choice is made before
          putting the split card with fuse onto the stack. The resulting spell is a fused split spell.</p>

        <p>702.101b A fused split spell has the combined characteristics of its two halves. (See rule 708.4.)</p>

        <p>702.101c The total cost of a fused split spell includes the mana cost of each half.</p>

        <p>702.101d As a fused split spell resolves, the controller of the spell follows the instructions of the left
          half and then follows the instructions of the right half.</p>

        <p>702.102. Bestow</p>

        <p>702.102a Bestow represents a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card
          itâs on. âBestow [cost]â means âAs you cast this spell, you may choose to cast it bestowed. If you do, you pay
          [cost] rather than its mana cost.â Casting a spell using its bestow ability follows the rules for paying
          alternative costs (see 601.2b and 601.2fâh).</p>

        <p>702.102b As a spell cast bestowed is put onto the stack, it becomes an Aura enchantment and gains enchant
          creature. It is a bestowed Aura spell, and the permanent it becomes as it resolves will be a bestowed Aura.
          These effects last until the spell or the permanent it becomes ceases to be bestowed (see rules 702.102dâf).
          Because the spell is an Aura spell, its controller must choose a legal target for that spell as defined by its
          enchant creature ability and rule 601.2c. See also rule 303.4.</p>

        <p>702.102c When casting a spell bestowed, only its characteristics as modified by the bestow ability are
          evaluated to determine if it can be cast.</p>
        <p>Example: Aether Storm is an enchantment with the ability âCreature spells canât be cast.â This effect doesnât
          stop a creature card with bestow from being cast bestowed.</p>
        <p>Example: Garrukâs Horde says, in part, âYou may cast creature spells from the top of your library.â If you
          control Garrukâs Horde and the top card of your library is a creature card with bestow, you can cast it as a
          creature spell, but you canât cast it bestowed.</p>

        <p>702.102d As a bestowed Aura spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be bestowed and
          the effect making it an Aura spell ends. It continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the
          battlefield under the control of the spellâs controller. This is an exception to rule 608.3a.</p>

        <p>702.102e If a bestowed Aura becomes unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. If a bestowed Aura is attached to
          an illegal object or player, it becomes unattached and ceases to be bestowed. This is an exception to rule
          704.5m.</p>

        <p>702.102f If a bestowed Aura phases in unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. See rule 702.25, âPhasing.â</p>

        <p>702.103. Tribute</p>

        <p>702.103a Tribute is a static ability that functions as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield.
          âTribute Nâ means âAs this creature enters the battlefield, choose an opponent. That player may put an
          additional N +1/+1 counters on it as it enters the battlefield.â</p>

        <p>702.103b Objects with tribute have triggered abilities that check âif tribute wasnât paid.â This condition is
          true if the opponent chosen as a result of the tribute ability didnât have the creature enter the battlefield
          with +1/+1 counters as specified by the creatureâs tribute ability.</p>

        <p>702.104. Dethrone</p>

        <p>702.104a Dethrone is a triggered ability. âDethroneâ means âWhenever this creature attacks the player with
          the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.â</p>

        <p>702.104b If a creature has multiple instances of dethrone, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.105. Hidden Agenda</p>

        <p>702.105a Hidden agenda is a static ability that functions as a conspiracy card with hidden agenda is put into
          the command zone. âHidden agendaâ means âAs you put this conspiracy card into the command zone, turn it face
          down and secretly choose a card name.â</p>

        <p>702.105b To secretly choose a card name, note that name on a piece of paper kept with the face-down
          conspiracy card.</p>

        <p>702.105c Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down conspiracy card you control in the command zone
          face up. This is a special action. Doing so will reveal the chosen name. See rule 116.2i.</p>

        <p>702.105d Hidden agenda and another ability of the object with hidden agenda that refers to âthe chosen nameâ
          are linked. The second ability refers only to the card name chosen as a result of that objectâs hidden agenda
          ability. See rule 607.2d.</p>

        <p>702.105e If a player leaves the game, all face-down conspiracy cards controlled by that player must be
          revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down conspiracy cards must be revealed to all
          players.</p>

        <p>702.105f Double agenda is a variant of the hidden agenda ability. As you put a conspiracy card with double
          agenda into the command zone, you secretly name two different cards rather than one. You donât reveal that
          more than one name was secretly chosen until you reveal the chosen names.</p>

        <p>702.106. Outlast</p>

        <p>702.106a Outlast is an activated ability. âOutlast [cost]â means â[Cost], {T}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this
          creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.107. Prowess</p>

        <p>702.107a Prowess is a triggered ability. âProwessâ means âWhenever you cast a noncreature spell, this
          creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.â</p>

        <p>702.107b If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.108. Dash</p>

        <p>702.108a Dash represents three abilities: two static abilities that function while the card with dash is on
          the stack, one of which may create a delayed triggered ability, and a static ability that functions while the
          object with dash is on the battlefield. âDash [cost]â means âYou may cast this card by paying [cost] rather
          than its mana cost,â âIf this spellâs dash cost was paid, return the permanent this spell becomes to its
          ownerâs hand at the beginning of the next end step,â and âAs long as this permanentâs dash cost was paid, it
          has haste.â Casting a spell for its dash cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b
          and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.109. Exploit</p>

        <p>702.109a Exploit is a triggered ability. âExploitâ means âWhen this creature enters the battlefield, you may
          sacrifice a creature.â</p>

        <p>702.109b A creature with exploit âexploits a creatureâ when the controller of the exploit ability sacrifices
          a creature as that ability resolves.</p>

        <p>702.110. Menace</p>

        <p>702.110a Menace is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.110b A creature with menace canât be blocked except by two or more creatures. (See rule 509, âDeclare
          Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.110c Multiple instances of menace on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.111. Renown</p>

        <p>702.111a Renown is a triggered ability. âRenown Nâ means âWhen this creature deals combat damage to a player,
          if it isnât renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned.â</p>

        <p>702.111b Renowned is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the renown
          ability and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become renowned. Once a
          permanent becomes renowned, it stays renowned until it leaves the battlefield. Renowned is neither an ability
          nor part of the permanentâs copiable values.</p>

        <p>702.111c If a creature has multiple instances of renown, each triggers separately. The first such ability to
          resolve will cause the creature to become renowned, and subsequent abilities will have no effect. (See rule
          603.4)</p>

        <p>702.112. Awaken</p>

        <p>702.112a Awaken appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities: a static ability that
          functions while the spell with awaken is on the stack and a spell ability. âAwaken Nâ[cost]â means âYou may
          pay [cost] rather than pay this spellâs mana cost as you cast this spellâ and âIf this spellâs awaken cost was
          paid, put N +1/+1 counters on target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste.
          Itâs still a land.â Casting a spell using its awaken ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in
          rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.112b The controller of a spell with awaken chooses the target of the awaken spell ability only if that
          player chose to pay the spellâs awaken cost. Otherwise the spell is cast as if it didnât have that target.</p>

        <p>702.113. Devoid</p>

        <p>702.113a Devoid is a characteristic-defining ability. âDevoidâ means âThis object is colorless.â This ability
          functions everywhere, even outside the game. See rule 604.3.</p>

        <p>702.114. Ingest</p>

        <p>702.114a Ingest is a triggered ability. âIngestâ means âWhenever this creature deals combat damage to a
          player, that player exiles the top card of their library.â</p>

        <p>702.114b If a creature has multiple instances of ingest, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.115. Myriad</p>

        <p>702.115a Myriad is a triggered ability that may also create a delayed triggered ability. âMyriadâ means
          âWhenever this creature attacks, for each opponent other than defending player, you may create a token thatâs
          a copy of this creature thatâs tapped and attacking that player or a planeswalker they control. If one or more
          tokens are created this way, exile the tokens at end of combat.â</p>

        <p>702.115b If a creature has multiple instances of myriad, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.116. Surge</p>

        <p>702.116a Surge is a static ability that functions while the spell with surge is on the stack. âSurge [cost]â
          means âYou may pay [cost] rather than pay this spellâs mana cost as you cast this spell if you or one of your
          teammates has cast another spell this turn.â Casting a spell for its surge cost follows the rules for paying
          alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.117. Skulk</p>

        <p>702.117a Skulk is an evasion ability.</p>

        <p>702.117b A creature with skulk canât be blocked by creatures with greater power. (See rule 509, âDeclare
          Blockers Step.â)</p>

        <p>702.117c Multiple instances of skulk on the same creature are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.118. Emerge</p>

        <p>702.118a Emerge represents two static abilities that function while the spell with emerge is on the stack.
          âEmerge [cost]â means âYou may cast this spell by paying [cost] and sacrificing a creature rather than paying
          its mana costâ and âIf you chose to pay this spellâs emerge cost, its total cost is reduced by an amount of
          generic mana equal to the sacrificed creatureâs converted mana cost.â Casting a spell using its emerge ability
          follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.118b You choose which creature to sacrifice as you choose to pay a spellâs emerge cost (see rule 601.2b),
          and you sacrifice that creature as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).</p>

        <p>702.119. Escalate</p>

        <p>702.119a Escalate is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell with
          escalate is on the stack. âEscalate [cost]â means âFor each mode you choose beyond the first as you cast this
          spell, you pay an additional [cost].â Paying a spellâs escalate cost follows the rules for paying additional
          costs in rules 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.120. Melee</p>

        <p>702.120a Melee is a triggered ability. âMeleeâ means âWhenever this creature attacks, it gets +1/+1 until end
          of turn for each opponent you attacked with a creature this combat.â</p>

        <p>702.120b If a creature has multiple instances of melee, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.121. Crew</p>

        <p>702.121a Crew is an activated ability of Vehicle cards. âCrew Nâ means âTap any number of untapped creatures
          you control with total power N or greater: This permanent becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.â</p>

        <p>702.121b A creature âcrews a Vehicleâ when itâs tapped to pay the cost to activate a Vehicleâs crew ability.
        </p>

        <p>702.121c If an effect states that a creature âcanât crew Vehicles,â that creature canât be tapped to pay the
          crew cost of a Vehicle.</p>

        <p>702.122. Fabricate</p>

        <p>702.122a Fabricate is a triggered ability. âFabricate Nâ means âWhen this permanent enters the battlefield,
          you may put N +1/+1 counters on it. If you donât, create N 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature tokens.â</p>

        <p>702.122b If a permanent has multiple instances of fabricate, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.123. Partner</p>

        <p>702.123a Partner is an ability that modifies the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant (see
          rule 903), and it functions before the game begins. Rather than a single legendary creature card, you may
          designate two legendary creature cards as your commander if each has partner.</p>

        <p>702.123b Your deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its two commanders. Both commanders begin the
          game in the command zone.</p>

        <p>702.123c A rule or effect that refers to your commanderâs color identity refers to the combined color
          identities of your two commanders. See rule 903.4.</p>

        <p>702.123d Except for determining the color identity of your commander, the two commanders function
          independently. When casting a commander with partner, ignore how many times your other commander has been cast
          (see rule 903.6). When determining whether a player has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same
          commander, consider damage from each of your two commanders separately (see rule 903.10a).</p>

        <p>702.123e If an effect refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to either one. If an
          effect causes you to perform an action on your commander and it could affect both, you choose which it refers
          to at the time the effect is applied.</p>

        <p>702.123f âPartner with [name]â is a variant of the partner ability. âPartner with [name]â represents two
          abilities. One is a static ability that modifies the rules for deck construction. Rather than a single
          legendary creature card, you may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander if each has a
          âpartner with [name]â ability with the otherâs name. You canât designate two legendary cards as your commander
          if one has a âpartner with [name]â ability and the other isnât the named card. The other ability represented
          by âpartner with [name]â is a triggered ability that means âWhen this permanent enters the battlefield, target
          player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle their
          library.â</p>

        <p>702.124. Undaunted</p>

        <p>702.124a Undaunted is a static ability that functions while the spell with undaunted is on the stack.
          Undaunted means âThis spell costs {1} less to cast for each opponent you have.â</p>

        <p>702.124b Players who have left the game are not counted when determining how many opponents you have.</p>

        <p>702.124c If a spell has multiple instances of undaunted, each of them applies.</p>

        <p>702.125. Improvise</p>

        <p>702.125a Improvise is a static ability that functions while the spell with improvise is on the stack.
          âImproviseâ means âFor each generic mana in this spellâs total cost, you may tap an untapped artifact you
          control rather than pay that mana.â</p>

        <p>702.125b The improvise ability isnât an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost
          of the spell with improvise is determined.</p>

        <p>702.125c Multiple instances of improvise on the same spell are redundant.</p>

        <p>702.126. Aftermath</p>

        <p>702.126a Aftermath is an ability found on some split cards (see rule 708, âSplit Cardsâ). It represents three
          static abilities. âAftermathâ means âYou may cast this half of this split card from your graveyard,â âThis
          half of this split card canât be cast from any zone other than a graveyard,â and âIf this spell was cast from
          a graveyard, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.â</p>

        <p>702.127. Embalm</p>

        <p>702.127a Embalm is an activated ability that functions while the card with embalm is in a graveyard. âEmbalm
          [cost]â means â[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token thatâs a copy of this card, except
          itâs white, it has no mana cost, and itâs a Zombie in addition to its other types. Activate this ability only
          any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.127b A token is âembalmedâ if itâs created by a resolving embalm ability.</p>

        <p>702.128. Eternalize</p>

        <p>702.128a Eternalize is an activated ability that functions while the card with eternalize is in a graveyard.
          âEternalize [cost]â means â[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Create a token thatâs a copy of this
          card, except itâs black, itâs 4/4, it has no mana cost, and itâs a Zombie in addition to its other types.
          Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <p>702.129. Afflict</p>

        <p>702.129a Afflict is a triggered ability. âAfflict Nâ means âWhenever this creature becomes blocked, defending
          player loses N life.â</p>

        <p>702.129b If a creature has multiple instances of afflict, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.130. Ascend</p>

        <p>702.130a Ascend on an instant or sorcery spell represents a spell ability. It means âIf you control ten or
          more permanents and you donât have the cityâs blessing, you get the cityâs blessing for the rest of the game.â
        </p>

        <p>702.130b Ascend on a permanent represents a static ability. It means âAny time you control ten or more
          permanents and you donât have the cityâs blessing, you get the cityâs blessing for the rest of the game.â</p>

        <p>702.130c The cityâs blessing is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that
          other rules and effects can identify. Any number of players may have the cityâs blessing at the same time.</p>

        <p>702.130d After a player gets the cityâs blessing, continuous effects are reapplied before the game checks to
          see if the game state or preceding events have matched any trigger conditions.</p>

        <p>702.131. Assist</p>

        <p>702.131a Assist is a static ability that modifies the rules of paying for the spell with assist (see rules
          601.2g-h). If the total cost to cast a spell with assist includes a generic mana component, before you
          activate mana abilities while casting it, you may choose another player. That player has a chance to activate
          mana abilities. Once that player chooses not to activate any more mana abilities, you have a chance to
          activate mana abilities. Before you begin to pay the total cost of the spell, the player you chose may pay for
          any amount of the generic mana in the spellâs total cost.</p>

        <p>702.132. Jump-Start</p>

        <p>702.132a Jump-start appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that
          functions while the card is in a playerâs graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack.
          âJump-startâ means âYou may cast this card from your graveyard by discarding a card as an additional cost to
          cast itâ and âIf this spell was cast using its jump-start ability, exile this card instead of putting it
          anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.â Casting a spell using its jump-start ability follows the
          rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.133. Mentor</p>

        <p>702.133a Mentor is a triggered ability. âMentorâ means âWhenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter
          on target attacking creature with power less than this creatureâs power.â</p>

        <p>702.133b If a creature has multiple instances of mentor, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.134. Afterlife</p>

        <p>702.134a Afterlife is a triggered ability. âAfterlife Nâ means âWhen this permanent is put into a graveyard
          from the battlefield, create N 1/1 white and black Spirit creature tokens with flying.â</p>

        <p>702.134b If a permanent has multiple instances of afterlife, each triggers separately.</p>

        <p>702.135. Riot</p>

        <p>702.135a Riot is a static ability. âRiotâ means âYou may have this permanent enter the battlefield with an
          additional +1/+1 counter on it. If you donât, it gains haste.â</p>

        <p>702.135b If a permanent has multiple instances of riot, each works separately.</p>

        <p>702.136. Spectacle</p>

        <p>702.136a Spectacle is a static ability that functions on the stack. âSpectacle [cost]â means âYou may pay
          [cost] rather than pay this spellâs mana cost if an opponent lost life this turn.â Casting a spell for its
          spectacle cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.137. Escape</p>

        <p>702.137a Escape represents a static ability that functions while the card with escape is in a playerâs
          graveyard. âEscape [cost]â means âYou may cast this card from your graveyard by paying [cost] rather than
          paying its mana cost.â Casting a spell using its escape ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs
          in rules 601.2b and 601.2fâh.</p>

        <p>702.137b A spell or permanent âescapedâ if that spell or the spell that became that permanent as it resolved
          was cast from a graveyard with an escape ability.</p>

        <p>702.137c An ability that reads â[This permanent] escapes with . . .â means âIf this permanent escaped, it
          enters the battlefield with . . .â That ability may have a triggered ability linked to it that triggers âWhen
          it enters the battlefield this way.â (See rule 603.11.) Such a triggered ability triggers when that permanent
          enters the battlefield after its replacement effect was applied, even if that replacement effect had no
          effect.</p>

        <p>702.138. Companion</p>

        <p>702.138a Companion is a keyword ability that functions outside the game. Itâs written as
          âCompanionâ[Condition].â Before the game begins, you may reveal one card you own from outside the game with a
          companion ability whose condition is fulfilled by your starting deck. (See rule 103.2b.) Once during the game,
          any time you have priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of your turn, you may pay {3}
          and put that card into your hand. This is a special action that doesnât use the stack (see rule 116.2g). This
          is a change from previous rules.</p>

        <p>702.138b If a companion ability refers to your starting deck, it refers to your deck after youâve set aside
          any sideboard cards. In a Commander game, this is also before youâve set aside your commander.</p>

        <p>702.138c Once you take the special action and put the card with companion into your hand, it remains in the
          game until the game ends.</p>

        <p>702.139. Mutate</p>

        <p>702.139a Mutate appears on some creature cards. It represents a static ability that functions while the spell
          with mutate is on the stack. âMutate [cost]â means âYou may pay [cost] rather than pay this spellâs mana cost.
          If you do, it becomes a mutating creature spell and targets a non-Human creature with the same owner as this
          spell.â Casting a spell using its mutate ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs (see 601.2b
          and 601.2fâh).</p>

        <p>702.139b As a mutating creature spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be a mutating
          creature spell and continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the battlefield under the
          control of the spellâs controller.</p>

        <p>702.139c As a mutating creature spell resolves, if its target is legal, it doesnât enter the battlefield.
          Rather, it merges with the target creature and becomes one object represented by more than one card or token
          (see rule 721, âMerging with Permanentsâ). The spellâs controller chooses whether the spell is put on top of
          the creature or on the bottom. The resulting permanent is a mutated permanent.</p>

        <p>702.139d An ability that triggers whenever a creature mutates triggers when a spell merges with a creature as
          a result of a resolving mutating creature spell.</p>

        <p>702.139e A mutated permanent has all abilities of each card and token that represents it. Its other
          characteristics are derived from the topmost card or token.</p>

        <p>702.139f Any effect that refers to or modifies the mutating creature spell refers to or modifies the mutated
          permanent it merges with as it resolves.</p>

        <h2 id="703">
          703. Turn-Based Actions
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>703.1. Turn-based actions are game actions that happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin, or
          when each step and phase ends. Turn-based actions donât use the stack.</p>

        <p>703.1a Abilities that watch for a specified step or phase to begin are triggered abilities, not turn-based
          actions. (See rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>703.2. Turn-based actions are not controlled by any player.</p>

        <p>703.3. Whenever a step or phase begins, if itâs a step or phase that has any turn-based action associated
          with it, those turn-based actions are automatically dealt with first. This happens before state-based actions
          are checked, before triggered abilities are put on the stack, and before players receive priority.</p>

        <p>703.4. The turn-based actions are as follows:</p>

        <p>703.4a Immediately after the untap step begins, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player
          controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase
          in. This all happens simultaneously. See rule 502.1.</p>

        <p>703.4b Immediately after the phasing action has been completed during the untap step, the active player
          determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. See rule 502.2.
        </p>

        <p>703.4c Immediately after the draw step begins, the active player draws a card. See rule 504.1.</p>

        <p>703.4d In an Archenemy game (see rule 904), immediately after the archenemyâs precombat main phase begins,
          that player sets the top card of their scheme deck in motion. See rule 701.25.</p>

        <p>703.4e Immediately after a playerâs precombat main phase begins, that player puts a lore counter on each Saga
          enchantment they control. In an Archenemy game, this happens after the archenemyâs scheme action. See rule
          714, âSaga Cards.â</p>

        <p>703.4f Immediately after the beginning of combat step begins, if the game being played is a multiplayer game
          in which the active playerâs opponents donât all automatically become defending players, the active player
          chooses one of their opponents. That player becomes the defending player. See rule 507.1.</p>

        <p>703.4g Immediately after the declare attackers step begins, the active player declares attackers. See rule
          508.1.</p>

        <p>703.4h Immediately after the declare blockers step begins, the defending player declares blockers. See rule
          509.1.</p>

        <p>703.4i Immediately after blockers have been declared during the declare blockers step, for each attacking
          creature thatâs become blocked by multiple creatures, the active player announces the damage assignment order
          among the blocking creatures. See rule 509.2.</p>

        <p>703.4j Immediately after the active player has announced damage assignment orders (if necessary) during the
          declare blockers step, for each creature thatâs blocking multiple creatures, the defending player announces
          the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures. See rule 509.3.</p>

        <p>703.4k Immediately after the combat damage step begins, each player in APNAP order announces how each
          attacking or blocking creature they control assigns its combat damage. See rule 510.1.</p>

        <p>703.4m Immediately after combat damage has been assigned during the combat damage step, all combat damage is
          dealt simultaneously. See rule 510.2.</p>

        <p>703.4n Immediately after the cleanup step begins, if the active playerâs hand contains more cards than their
          maximum hand size (normally seven), they discard enough cards to reduce their hand size to that number. See
          rule 514.1.</p>

        <p>703.4p Immediately after the active player has discarded cards (if necessary) during the cleanup step, all
          damage is removed from permanents and all âuntil end of turnâ and âthis turnâ effects end. These actions
          happen simultaneously. See rule 514.2.</p>

        <p>703.4q When each step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a playerâs mana pool empties. See rule 500.4.
        </p>

        <h2 id="704">
          704. State-Based Actions
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>704.1. State-based actions are game actions that happen automatically whenever certain conditions (listed
          below) are met. State-based actions donât use the stack.</p>

        <p>704.1a Abilities that watch for a specified game state are triggered abilities, not state-based actions. (See
          rule 603, âHandling Triggered Abilities.â)</p>

        <p>704.2. State-based actions are checked throughout the game and are not controlled by any player.</p>

        <p>704.3. Whenever a player would get priority (see rule 117, âTiming and Priorityâ), the game checks for any of
          the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions simultaneously
          as a single event. If any state-based actions are performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated;
          otherwise all triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the stack, then the check
          is repeated. Once no more state-based actions have been performed as the result of a check and no triggered
          abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority. This process also occurs
          during the cleanup step (see rule 514), except that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of
          the stepâs first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, then no player gets
          priority and the step ends.</p>

        <p>704.4. Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution
          of a spell or ability.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls a creature with the ability âThis creatureâs power and toughness are each equal to
          the number of cards in your handâ and casts a spell whose effect is âDiscard your hand, then draw seven
          cards.â The creature will temporarily have toughness 0 in the middle of the spellâs resolution but will be
          back up to toughness 7 when the spell finishes resolving. Thus the creature will survive when state-based
          actions are checked. In contrast, an ability that triggers when the player has no cards in hand goes on the
          stack after the spell resolves, because its trigger event happened during resolution.</p>

        <h3>
          <p>704.5. The state-based actions are as follows:</p>

        <p>704.5a If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game.</p>

        <p>704.5b If a player attempted to draw a card from a library with no cards in it since the last time
          state-based actions were checked, that player loses the game.</p>

        <p>704.5c If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game. Ignore this rule in
          Two-Headed Giant games; see rule 704.6b instead.</p>

        <p>704.5d If a token is in a zone other than the battlefield, it ceases to exist.</p>

        <p>704.5e If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in
          any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist.</p>

        <p>704.5f If a creature has toughness 0 or less, itâs put into its ownerâs graveyard. Regeneration canât replace
          this event.</p>

        <p>704.5g If a creature has toughness greater than 0, it has damage marked on it, and the total damage marked on
          it is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed.
          Regeneration can replace this event.</p>

        <p>704.5h If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and itâs been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch
          since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace
          this event.</p>

        <p>704.5i If a planeswalker has loyalty 0, itâs put into its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>704.5j If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of
          them, and the rest are put into their ownersâ graveyards. This is called the âlegend rule.â</p>

        <p>704.5k If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the one that has had the world
          supertype for the shortest amount of time are put into their ownersâ graveyards. In the event of a tie for the
          shortest amount of time, all are put into their ownersâ graveyards. This is called the âworld rule.â</p>

        <p>704.5m If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, or is not attached to an object or player, that
          Aura is put into its ownerâs graveyard.</p>

        <p>704.5n If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent or to a player, it becomes
          unattached from that permanent or player. It remains on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>704.5p If a creature is attached to an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the
          battlefield. Similarly, if a permanent thatâs neither an Aura, an Equipment, nor a Fortification is attached
          to an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield.</p>

        <p>704.5q If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are
          removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.</p>

        <p>704.5r If a permanent with an ability that says it canât have more than N counters of a certain kind on it
          has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it.</p>

        <p>704.5s If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent is greater than or equal to its final chapter
          number and it isnât the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Sagaâs
          controller sacrifices it. See rule 714, âSaga Cards.â</p>

        <p>704.6. Some variant games include additional state-based actions that arenât normally applicable:</p>

        <p>704.6a In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has 0 or less life, that team loses the game. See rule 810,
          âTwo-Headed Giant Variant.â</p>

        <p>704.6b In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game.
          See rule 810, âTwo-Headed Giant Variant.â</p>

        <p>704.6c In a Commander game, a player thatâs been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over
          the course of the game loses the game. See rule 903, âCommander.â</p>

        <p>704.6d In a Commander game, if a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that card was put into that zone
          since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. See rule
          903, âCommander.â</p>

        <p>704.6e In an Archenemy game, if a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered
          abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face
          down and put on the bottom of its ownerâs scheme deck. See rule 904, âArchenemy.â</p>

        <p>704.6f In a Planechase game, if a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isnât the source of
          a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks. See rule
          901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <p>704.7. If multiple state-based actions would have the same result at the same time, a single replacement
          effect will replace all of them.</p>
        <p>Example: You control Lichâs Mirror, which says âIf you would lose the game, instead shuffle your hand, your
          graveyard, and all permanents you own into your library, then draw seven cards and your life total becomes
          20.â Thereâs one card in your library and your life total is 1. A spell causes you to draw two cards and lose
          2 life. The next time state-based actions are checked, youâd lose the game due to rule 704.5a and rule 704.5b.
          Instead, Lichâs Mirror replaces that game loss and you keep playing.</p>

        <p>704.8. If a state-based action results in a permanent leaving the battlefield at the same time other
          state-based actions were performed, that permanentâs last known information is derived from the game state
          before any of those state-based actions were performed.</p>
        <p>Example: You control Young Wolf, a 1/1 creature with undying, and it has a +1/+1 counter on it. A spell puts
          three -1/-1 counters on Young Wolf. Before state-based actions are performed, Young Wolf has one +1/+1 counter
          and three -1/-1 counters on it. After state-based actions are performed, Young Wolf is in the graveyard. When
          it was last on the battlefield, it had a +1/+1 counter on it, so undying will not trigger.</p>

          705. Flipping a Coin
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>705.1. An effect that instructs a player to flip a coin may care whether that player wins or loses the flip.
          To flip a coin for such an effect, the player flips the coin and calls âheadsâ or âtails.â If the call matches
          the result, the player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin
          wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.</p>

        <p>705.2. If an effect instructs a player to flip a coin and that effect cares only whether the coin comes up
          heads or tails without specifying a winner or loser of the flip, that player flips a coin without making a
          call. No player wins or loses this kind of flip.</p>

        <p>705.3. A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily distinguished sides and equal likelihood
          that either side lands face up. If the coin thatâs being flipped doesnât have an obvious âheadsâ or âtails,â
          designate one side to be âheads,â and the other side to be âtails.â Other methods of randomization may be
          substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players
          agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call âoddsâ or âevens,â or
          roll an even-sided die and designate that âoddsâ means âheadsâ and âevensâ means âtails.â</p>

        <h2 id="706">
          706. Copying Objects
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>706.1. Some objects become or turn another object into a âcopyâ of a spell, permanent, or card. Some effects
          create a token thatâs a copy of another object. (Certain older cards were printed with the phrase âsearch for
          a copy.â This section doesnât cover those cards, which have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)
        </p>

        <p>706.2. When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original objectâs characteristics
          and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X,
          whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The copiable values are the values
          derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type,
          subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its
          face-down status, and by âas . . . enters the battlefieldâ and âas . . . is turned face upâ abilities that set
          power and toughness (and may also set additional characteristics). Other effects (including type-changing and
          text-changing effects), status, and counters are not copied.</p>
        <p>Example: Chimeric Staff is an artifact that reads, â{X}: Chimeric Staff becomes an X/X artifact creature
          until end of turn.â Clone is a creature that reads, âYou may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any
          creature on the battlefield.â After a Staff has become a 5/5 artifact creature, a Clone enters the battlefield
          as a copy of it. The Clone is an artifact, not a 5/5 artifact creature. (The copy has the Staffâs ability,
          however, and will become a creature if that ability is activated.)</p>
        <p>Example: Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph
          {2}{B}{B}). The Clone is a colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no types, no abilities, and no mana cost. It
          will still be face up. Its controller canât pay {2}{B}{B} to turn it face up.</p>

        <p>706.2a A copy acquires the color of the object itâs copying because that value is derived from its mana cost
          or color indicator. A copy acquires the abilities of the object itâs copying because those values are derived
          from its rules text. A copy doesnât wind up with two values of each ability (that is, it doesnât copy the
          objectâs abilities and its rules text, then have that rules text define a new set of abilities).</p>

        <p>706.2b Once an object has been copied, changing the copiable values of the original object wonât cause the
          copy to change.</p>

        <p>706.2c If a static ability generates a continuous effect thatâs a copy effect, the copiable values that
          effect grants are determined only at the time that effect first starts to apply.</p>

        <p>706.3. The copyâs copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copyâs status (see rule
          110.5). Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.</p>
        <p>Example: Vesuvan Doppelganger reads, âYou may have Vesuvan Doppelganger enter the battlefield as a copy of
          any creature on the battlefield, except it doesnât copy that creatureâs color and it gains âAt the beginning
          of your upkeep, you may have this creature become a copy of target creature, except it doesnât copy that
          creatureâs color. If you do, this creature gains this ability.ââ A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield
          as a copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 green Bear creature with no abilities). Then a Clone enters the battlefield
          as a copy of the Doppelganger. The Clone is a 2/2 blue Bear named Runeclaw Bear that has the Doppelgangerâs
          upkeep-triggered ability.</p>
        <p>Example: Tomoya the Revealer (a flipped flip card) becomes a copy of Nezumi Shortfang (an unflipped flip
          card). Tomoyaâs characteristics become the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious, which is the flipped
          version of Nezumi Shortfang.</p>
        <p>Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of a face-up Branchsnap Lorian (a
          4/1 green creature with trample and morph {G}). The Demonâs characteristics become the characteristics of
          Branchsnap Lorian. However, since the creature is face down, it remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name,
          types, or abilities, and no mana cost. It can be turned face up for {G}. If itâs turned face up, it will have
          the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian.</p>
        <p>Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of Wandering Ones (a 1/1 blue
          Spirit creature that doesnât have morph). It will be a face-down Wandering Ones. It remains a 2/2 colorless
          creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. Its controller canât turn it face up as a
          special action. If an effect turns it face up, it will have the characteristics of Wandering Ones.</p>

        <p>706.4. Some effects cause a permanent thatâs copying a permanent to copy a different object while remaining
          on the battlefield. The change doesnât trigger enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities.
          This also doesnât change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.</p>
        <p>Example: Unstable Shapeshifter reads, âWhenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter
          becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability.â Itâs affected by Giant Growth, which reads âTarget
          creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.â If a creature enters the battlefield later this turn, Unstable
          Shapeshifter will become a copy of that creature, but it will still get +3/+3 from the Giant Growth.</p>

        <p>706.5. An object that enters the battlefield âas a copyâ or âthatâs a copyâ of another object becomes a copy
          as it enters the battlefield. It doesnât enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent. If
          the text thatâs being copied includes any abilities that replace the enters-the-battlefield event (such as
          âenters the battlefield withâ or âas [this] enters the battlefieldâ abilities), those abilities will take
          effect. Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy will have a chance to trigger.</p>
        <p>Example: Skyshroud Behemoth reads, âFading 2 (This creature enters the battlefield with two fade counters on
          it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from it. If you canât, sacrifice it.)â and
          âSkyshroud Behemoth enters the battlefield tapped.â A Clone that enters the battlefield as a copy of a
          Skyshroud Behemoth will also enter the battlefield tapped with two fade counters on it.</p>
        <p>Example: Wall of Omens reads, âWhen Wall of Omens enters the battlefield, draw a card.â A Clone enters the
          battlefield as a copy of Wall of Omens. The Clone has the Wallâs enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, so
          the Cloneâs controller draws a card.</p>

        <p>706.6. When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent arenât copied. Instead,
          if an object enters the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, the objectâs controller will get to make
          any âas [this] enters the battlefieldâ choices for it.</p>
        <p>Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Adaptive Automaton. Adaptive Automaton reads, in part,
          âAs Adaptive Automaton enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.â The Clone wonât copy the creature type
          choice of the Automaton; rather, the controller of the Clone will get to make a new choice.</p>

        <p>706.7. If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be similarly linked to one another on
          the object that copied them. One ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were affected
          by the other. They canât be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the copy may
          currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, âLinked Abilities.â</p>

        <p>706.8. When copying a double-faced permanent, a face-up meld card, or a melded permanent, only the copiable
          values of the face thatâs currently up are copied. (See rule 711, âDouble-Faced Cards,â and rule 712, âMeld
          Cards.â)</p>

        <p>706.9. Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process.</p>

        <p>706.9a Some copy effects cause the copy to gain an ability as part of the copying process. This ability
          becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied.</p>
        <p>Example: Quirion Elves enters the battlefield and an Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. The copiable values of
          the Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter also has the ability âWhenever a
          creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature, except it has this
          ability.â Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter. The Clone copies the new
          copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied
          the Elves.</p>

        <p>706.9b Some copy effects specifically state that they donât copy certain characteristics and instead retain
          their original values. They may also simply state that certain characteristics are not copied.</p>

        <p>706.9c Some copy effects modify a characteristic as part of the copying process. The final value(s) for that
          characteristic becomes part of the copiable values for the copy.</p>
        <p>Example: Copy Artifact is an enchantment that reads, âYou may have Copy Artifact enter the battlefield as a
          copy of any artifact on the battlefield, except itâs an enchantment in addition to its other types.â It enters
          the battlefield as a copy of Juggernaut. The copiable values of the Copy Artifact now match those of
          Juggernaut with one modification: its types are now artifact, creature, and enchantment.</p>

        <p>706.9d When applying a copy effect that doesnât copy a certain characteristic, retains an original value for
          a certain characteristic, or modifies the final value of a certain characteristic, any characteristic-defining
          ability (see rule 604.3) of the object being copied that defines that characteristic is not copied. If that
          characteristic is color, any color indicator (see rule 204) of that object is also not copied.</p>
        <p>Example: Quicksilver Gargantuan is a creature that reads, âYou may have Quicksilver Gargantuan enter the
          battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except itâs 7/7.â Quicksilver Gargantuan enters the
          battlefield as a copy of Tarmogoyf, which has a characteristic-defining ability that defines its power and
          toughness. Quicksilver Gargantuan does not have that ability. It will be 7/7.</p>

        <p>706.9e Some replacement effects that generate copy effects include an exception thatâs an additional effect
          rather than a modification of the affected objectâs characteristics. If another copy effect is applied to that
          object after applying the copy effect with that exception, the exceptionâs effect doesnât happen.</p>
        <p>Example: Altered Ego reads, âYou may have Altered Ego enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the
          battlefield, except it enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it.â You choose for it to enter the
          battlefield as a copy of Clone, which reads âYou may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any
          creature on the battlefield,â for which no creature was chosen as it entered the battlefield. If you then
          choose a creature to copy as you apply the replacement effect Altered Ego gains by copying Clone, Altered
          Egoâs replacement effect wonât cause it to enter the battlefield with any +1/+1 counters on it.</p>

        <p>706.9f Some replacement effects that generate copy effects are linked to triggered abilities written in the
          same paragraph. (See rule 603.11.) If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy
          effect with the linked triggered ability, the ability doesnât trigger.</p>

        <p>706.10. To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a
          copy of a spell isnât cast and a copy of an activated ability isnât activated. A copy of a spell or ability
          copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes,
          targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â) Choices that
          are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its
          costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned
          by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the
          player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no
          spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability.</p>
        <p>Example: A player casts Fork, targeting an Emerald Charm. Fork reads, âCopy target instant or sorcery spell,
          except that the copy is red. You may choose new targets for the copy.â Emerald Charm is a modal green instant.
          When the Fork resolves, it puts a copy of the Emerald Charm on the stack except the copy is red, not green.
          The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm. It does not necessarily have the
          same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets.</p>
        <p>Example: Fling is an instant that reads, âAs an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creatureâ and
          âFling deals damage equal to the sacrificed creatureâs power to any target.â When determining how much damage
          a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling.</p>
        <p>Example: Dawnglow Infusion is a sorcery that reads, âYou gain X life if {G} was spent to cast this spell and
          X life if {W} was spent to cast it.â Because mana isnât an object, a copy of Dawnglow Infusion wonât cause you
          to gain any life, no matter what mana was spent to cast the original spell.</p>

        <p>706.10a If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in
          any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist. These are state-based actions. See rule
          704.</p>

        <p>706.10b A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source
          by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is
          considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the
          turn.</p>

        <p>706.10c Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the
          copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the
          player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has
          decided what the copyâs targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets.</p>

        <p>706.10d Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it âcould target.â The copies are put
          onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controllerâs choice. If the spell or ability has more
          than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isnât a legal
          target for each instance of the word âtarget,â a copy isnât created for that player or object.</p>

        <p>706.10e Some effects copy a spell or ability and specify a new target for the copy. If the spell or ability
          has more than one target, each of the copyâs targets must be that player or object. If that player or object
          isnât a legal target for each instance of the word âtarget,â the copy isnât created.</p>

        <p>706.10f Some effects copy a permanent spell. As that copy resolves, it ceases being a copy of a spell and
          becomes a token permanent. (See rule 608.3b.)</p>

        <p>706.11. If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes
          names or becomes a copy of something else.</p>
        <p>Example: An Unstable Shapeshifter copies a Crazed Armodon. Crazed Armodon reads, â{G}: Crazed Armodon gets
          +3/+0 and gains trample until end of turn. Destroy Crazed Armodon at the beginning of the next end step.
          Activate this ability only once each turn.â If this ability of the Shapeshifter is activated, the Shapeshifter
          will be destroyed at the beginning of the next end step, even if itâs no longer a copy of Crazed Armodon at
          that time.</p>

        <p>706.12. An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the
          rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast
          while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2aâh of rule 601,
          âCasting Spells,â and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like
          any other spell it can resolve or be countered.</p>

          707. Face-Down Spells and Permanents
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>707.1. Some cards allow spells and permanents to be face down.</p>

        <p>707.2. Face-down spells and face-down permanents have no characteristics other than those listed by the
          ability or rules that allowed the spell or permanent to be face down. Any listed characteristics are the
          copiable values of that objectâs characteristics. (See rule 613, âInteraction of Continuous Effects,â and rule
          706, âCopying Objects.â)</p>

        <p>707.2a If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability that doesnât list any characteristics
          for that object, it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. A
          permanent that enters the battlefield face down also has these characteristics unless otherwise specified by
          the effect that put it onto the battlefield face down or allowed it to be cast face down. These values are the
          copiable values of that objectâs characteristics.</p>

        <p>707.3. Objects that are put onto the battlefield face down are turned face down before they enter the
          battlefield, so the permanentâs enters-the-battlefield abilities wonât trigger (if triggered) or have any
          effect (if static).</p>

        <p>707.4. Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects
          that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spellâs characteristics. Any
          effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these characteristics (and not the face-up
          objectâs characteristics) are applied to casting this object. The permanent the spell becomes will be a
          face-down permanent.</p>

        <p>707.5. At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack or a face-down permanent you
          control (even if itâs phased out). You canât look at face-down cards in any other zone or face-down spells or
          permanents controlled by another player.</p>

        <p>707.6. If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents, you must ensure at all times that
          your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not
          limited to, knowing what ability or rules caused the permanents to be face down, the order spells were cast,
          the order that face-down permanents entered the battlefield, which creature(s) attacked last turn, and any
          other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down
          objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in
          order on the table.</p>

        <p>707.7. The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also allow the permanentâs controller
          to turn it face up. Spells normally canât be turned face up.</p>

        <p>707.8. As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values revert to its normal copiable values.
          Any effects that have been applied to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent. Any
          abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield donât trigger and donât have any effect, because
          the permanent has already entered the battlefield.</p>

        <p>707.9. If a face-down permanent or a face-down component of a merged permanent moves from the battlefield to
          any other zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a face-down spell moves from the
          stack to any zone other than the battlefield, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a
          player leaves the game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down
          spells owned by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down
          permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells must be revealed to all players.
        </p>

        <p>707.10. If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its copiable values become the copiable
          values of that permanent, as modified by its face-down status. Its characteristics therefore remain the same:
          the characteristics listed by the ability or rules that allowed it to be turned face down. However, if it is
          turned face up, its copiable values become the values it copied from the other permanent. See rule 706.3.</p>

        <p>707.11. If a face-down permanent would have an âAs [this permanent] is turned face up . . .â ability after
          itâs turned face up, that ability is applied while that permanent is being turned face up, not afterward.</p>

        <h2 id="708">
          708. Split Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>708.1. Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card
          back.</p>

        <p>708.2. Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player
          who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.</p>

        <p>708.3. A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.</p>

        <p>708.3a Only the chosen half is evaluated to see if it can be cast. Only that half is considered to be put
          onto the stack.</p>

        <p>708.3b While on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast exist. The other halfâs
          characteristics are treated as though they didnât exist.</p>

        <p>708.3c An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the
          characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule 706.12.)
        </p>

        <p>708.4. In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves
          combined. This is a change from previous rules.</p>

        <p>708.4a Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player
          wants to choose a split cardâs name, the player must choose one of those names and not both. An object has the
          chosen name if one of its names is the chosen name.</p>

        <p>708.4b The mana cost of a split card is the combined mana costs of its two halves. A split cardâs colors and
          converted mana cost are determined from its combined mana cost. An effect that refers specifically to the
          symbols in a split cardâs mana cost sees the separate symbols rather than the whole mana cost.</p>
        <p>Example: Assault//Batteryâs mana cost is {3}{R}{G}. Itâs a red and green card with a converted mana cost of
          5. If you cast Assault, the resulting spell is a red spell with a converted mana cost of 1.</p>
        <p>Example: Fire//Iceâs mana cost is {2}{U}{R}. It has the same mana cost as Steam Augury, but an effect such as
          that of Jegantha, the Wellspring sees that it contains the mana symbol {1} twice.</p>

        <p>708.4c A split card has each card type specified on either of its halves and each ability in the text box of
          each half.</p>

        <p>708.4d The characteristics of a fused split spell on the stack are also those of its two halves combined (see
          rule 702.101, âFuseâ).</p>

        <h2 id="709">
          709. Flip Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>709.1. Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the
          card defines the cardâs normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on
          the card. The back of a flip card is the normal Magic card back.</p>

        <p>709.1a The top half of a flip card contains the cardâs normal name, text box, type line, power, and
          toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to âflipâ if certain conditions
          are met.</p>

        <p>709.1b The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and
          toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is on the battlefield and only if the
          permanent is flipped.</p>

        <p>709.1c A flip cardâs color and mana cost donât change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by
          external effects will still apply.</p>

        <p>709.2. In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield before the permanent flips, a
          flip card has only the normal characteristics of the card. Once a permanent is flipped, its normal name, text
          box, type line, power, and toughness donât apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply
          instead.</p>
        <p>Example: Akki Lavarunner is a nonlegendary creature that flips into a legendary creature named Tok-Tok,
          Volcano Born. An effect that says âSearch your library for a legendary cardâ canât find this flip card. An
          effect that says âLegendary creatures get +2/+2â doesnât affect Akki Lavarunner, but it does affect Tok-Tok.
        </p>

        <p>709.3. You must ensure that itâs clear at all times whether a permanent you control is flipped or not, both
          when itâs untapped and when itâs tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped
          permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.</p>

        <p>709.4. Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, itâs impossible for it to
          become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its status.
          See rule 110.5.</p>

        <p>709.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a flip cardâs
          alternative name, the player may do so.</p>

        <h2 id="710">
          710. Leveler Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>710.1. Each leveler card has a striated text box and three power/toughness boxes. The text box of a leveler
          card contains two level symbols.</p>

        <p>710.2. A level symbol is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either
          a range of numbers, indicated here as âN1-N2,â or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as
          âN3+.â Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static
          ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as â[P/T].â
        </p>

        <p>710.2a â{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]â means âAs long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on
          it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].â</p>

        <p>710.2b â{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]â means âAs long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it,
          it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].â</p>

        <p>710.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and
          which power/toughness box are associated with which level symbol. Leveler cards each contain only one text
          box.</p>

        <p>710.4. Any ability a leveler card has that isnât preceded by a level symbol is treated normally. In
          particular, each leveler permanent has its level up ability (see rule 702.86) at all times; it may be
          activated regardless of how many level counters are on that permanent.</p>

        <p>710.5. If the number of level counters on a leveler creature is less than N1 (the first number printed in its
          {LEVEL N1-N2} symbol), it has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.</p>

        <p>710.6. In every zone other than the battlefield, a leveler card has the power and toughness denoted by its
          uppermost power/toughness box.</p>

        <h2 id="711">
          711. Double-Faced Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>711.1. A double-faced card has a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a
          Magic card back on the other. There are two kinds of double-faced cards. Transforming double-faced cards
          include abilities on one or both of their faces that allow the card to âtransformâ (turn over to its other
          face) or allow the card to enter the battlefield âtransformedâ (with its back face up). Modal double-faced
          cards have two faces that are independent from one another and canât transform.</p>

        <p>711.1a A transforming double-faced cardâs front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left
          corner. On Magic OriginsÂ® and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a modified
          Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistradâ¢ block and Shadows over Innistrad set, as well as on Ulrich of
          the Krallenhorde in the Eldritch Moonâ¢ set, the front-face symbol is a sun. On other Eldritch Moon
          double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a full moon. On Ixalanâ¢ and Rivals of Ixalanâ¢ cards, the
          front-face symbol is a compass rose.</p>

        <p>711.1b A transforming double-faced cardâs back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner.
          On Magic Origins and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a full Planeswalker icon. On
          cards in the Innistrad block and Shadows over Innistrad set, as well as on Ulrich, Uncontested Alpha in the
          Eldritch Moon set, the back-face symbol is a crescent moon. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the
          back-face symbol is a stylized image of Emrakul. On Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan cards, the back-face symbol is
          a land icon.</p>

        <p>711.1c The front face of a transforming double-faced card whose back face is a creature has the back faceâs
          power and toughness printed in gray above the power and toughness box. This is reminder text and has no effect
          on game play.</p>

        <p>711.1d A modal double-faced cardâs front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. The
          front-face symbol is a single black triangle inside a sideways teardrop.</p>

        <p>711.1e A modal double-faced cardâs back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. The
          back-face symbol is two white triangles inside a sideways teardrop.</p>

        <p>711.1f Each face of a modal double-faced card includes a hint bar in the lower left corner with information
          about the opposite face. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.</p>

        <p>711.1g Meld cards have a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other.
          These arenât double-faced cards and are subject to their own set of rules. See rule 712, âMeld Cards.â</p>

        <p>711.2. Players who are allowed to look at a double-faced card may look at both faces.</p>

        <p>711.3. Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in
          the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves and/or a
          substitute card (see rule 713). Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced
          cards. See rule 100.6.</p>

        <p>711.4. Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics.</p>

        <p>711.4a While a double-faced card is outside the game or in a zone other than the battlefield or stack, it has
          only the characteristics of its front face.</p>

        <p>711.4b While a transforming double-faced spell is on the stack or a transforming double-faced permanent has
          its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.</p>

        <p>711.4c While a transforming double-faced permanent has its back face up, it has only the characteristics of
          its back face. However, its converted mana cost is calculated using the mana cost of its front face. If a
          permanent is copying the back face of a transforming double-faced card (even if the card representing that
          copy is itself a double-faced card), the converted mana cost of that permanent is 0.</p>

        <p>711.4d While a modal double-faced spell is on the stack or a modal double-faced permanent is on the
          battlefield, it has only the characteristics of the face thatâs up.</p>

        <p>711.5. Only permanents represented by transforming double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 701.28,
          âTransform.â) If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform any permanent that isnât represented by a
          transforming double-faced card, nothing happens.</p>
        <p>Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wildblood Pack (the back face of a transforming
          double-faced card). The Clone will be a copy of the Wildblood Pack. Because the Clone is itself not a
          transforming double-faced card, it canât transform.</p>
        <p>Example: A player casts Cytoshape, causing a Kruin Outlaw (the front face of a transforming double-faced
          card) to become a copy of Elite Vanguard (a 2/1 Human Soldier creature) until end of turn. The player then
          casts Moonmist, which reads, in part, âTransform all Humans.â Because the copy of Elite Vanguard is a
          transforming double-faced card, it will transform. The resulting permanent will have its back face up, but it
          will still be a copy of Elite Vanguard that turn.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Blackbloom Rogue, a Human Rogue thatâs the front face of a modal double-faced
          card. They cast Moonmist. Blackbloom Rogue doesnât transform.</p>

        <p>711.6. If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would
          transform into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, nothing happens.</p>

        <p>711.7. If a transforming double-faced card is cast as a spell, itâs put on the stack with its front face up.
          A player casting a modal double-faced card as a spell chooses which face they are casting before putting it
          onto the stack. See rule 601, âCasting Spells.â</p>

        <p>711.7a Only the face that will be face up on the stack is evaluated to determine if it can be cast. Only that
          face is considered to be put onto the stack.</p>

        <p>711.8. A resolving transforming double-faced spell is put onto the battlefield front face up. A resolving
          modal double-faced spell that becomes a permanent is put onto the battlefield with the same face up that was
          face up on the stack.</p>

        <p>711.9. A double-faced card put onto the battlefield from a zone other than the stack enters the battlefield
          with its front face up by default.</p>

        <p>711.9a If a spell or ability puts a transforming double-faced card onto the battlefield âtransformed,â it
          enters the battlefield with its back face up. If a player is instructed to put a card that isnât a
          transforming double-faced card onto the battlefield transformed, that card stays in its current zone.</p>

        <p>711.9b If a player is instructed to put a modal double-faced card onto the battlefield and its front face
          isnât a permanent card, the card stays in its current zone.</p>

        <p>711.10. If an effect allows a player to cast a double-faced card as a face-down creature spell, or if a
          double-faced card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule
          or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card (see
          rule 713) and/or opaque sleeves. See rule 707, âFace-Down Spells and Permanents.â</p>

        <p>711.10a While face down, a transforming double-faced permanent canât transform. If itâs turned face up, it
          will have its front face up.</p>

        <p>711.11. Double-faced permanents canât be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn a double-faced
          permanent face down, nothing happens.</p>

        <p>711.12. A double-faced card that is exiled face down remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card and/or
          opaque sleeves. See rule 713, âSubstitute Cards.â</p>

        <p>711.13. When a transforming double-faced permanent transforms, it doesnât become a new object. Any effects
          that applied to that permanent will continue to apply to it after it transforms.</p>
        <p>Example: An effect gives Village Ironsmith (the front face of a transforming double-faced card) +2/+2 until
          end of turn and then Village Ironsmith transforms into Ironfang. Ironfang will continue to get +2/+2 until end
          of turn.</p>

        <p>711.14. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may name either face of a
          double-faced card but not both.</p>

          712. Meld Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>712.1. A meld card has a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other.
          It doesnât have a Magic card back.</p>

        <p>712.1a There are three specific meld pairs. Each meld pair consists of two specific cards whose back faces
          combine to form one oversized Magic card face: Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats meld to form Chittering Host;
          Hanweir Garrison and Hanweir Battlements meld to form Hanweir, the Writhing Township; and Bruna, the Fading
          Light and Gisela, the Broken Blade meld to form Brisela, Voice of Nightmares.</p>

        <p>712.1b A meld card isnât a double-faced card. Its back face canât be cast or put onto the battlefield, and it
          canât transform or enter the battlefield transformed. (See rule 711, âDouble-Faced Cards.â)</p>

        <p>712.2. One card in each meld pair has an ability that exiles both that object and its counterpart and melds
          them. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and
          combined (see rule 701.37, âMeldâ). The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.</p>

        <p>712.3. The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of
          characteristics.</p>

        <p>712.3a While a meld card is outside the game, in a zone other than the battlefield, or on the battlefield
          with its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.</p>

        <p>712.3b While the two cards of a meld pair are on the battlefield as a melded permanent, the object
          represented by those cards has only the characteristics of the combined back face, and its converted mana cost
          is the sum of the converted mana costs of its front faces. If a permanent is copying a melded permanent, the
          converted mana cost of the copy is 0. See rule 202.3c.</p>

        <p>712.3c Anything that needs information about a meld card or a melded permanent sees only the information
          given by the face that is currently up.</p>
        <p>Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Chittering Host (the combined back face of a meld pair).
          It has the characteristics of Chittering Host, even though the object it becomes is represented by only a
          single card, and its converted mana cost is 0.</p>

        <p>712.4. If a melded permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and two cards are
          put into the appropriate zone.</p>
        <p>Example: Chittering Host, a melded permanent, dies. An ability that triggers âwhenever a creature diesâ
          triggers once. An ability that triggers âwhenever a card is put into a graveyard from anywhereâ triggers
          twice.</p>

        <p>712.4a If a melded permanent is put into its ownerâs graveyard or library, that player may arrange the two
          cards in any order. If itâs put into its ownerâs library, that player doesnât reveal the order.</p>

        <p>712.4b If a player exiles a melded permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the two
          cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 613.7k.</p>
        <p>Example: Duplicant is a card with the abilities âWhen Duplicant enters the battlefield, you may exile target
          nontoken creatureâ and âAs long as a card exiled with Duplicant is a creature card, Duplicant has the power,
          toughness, and creature types of the last creature card exiled with Duplicant. Itâs still a Shapeshifter.â As
          Duplicantâs first ability exiles Chittering Host, a melded permanent, Duplicantâs controller chooses whether
          the last creature card exiled is Midnight Scavengers or Graf Rats.</p>

        <p>712.4c If an effect can find the new object that a melded permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it
          finds both cards. (See rule 400.7.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those cards, the same
          actions are taken upon each of them.</p>
        <p>Example: Otherworldly Journey is an instant that reads âExile target creature. At the beginning of the next
          end step, return that card to the battlefield under its ownerâs control with a +1/+1 counter on it.â A player
          casts Otherworldly Journey targeting Chittering Host, a melded permanent. Chittering Host is exiled. At the
          beginning of the next end step, Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both returned to the battlefield, each
          with a +1/+1 counter on it.</p>
        <p>Example: False Demise is an Aura with the ability âWhen enchanted creature dies, return that card to the
          battlefield under your control.â A Chittering Host enchanted by False Demise dies. The triggered ability
          returns both Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats to the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Example: Mimic Vat is an artifact that reads, in part, âWhenever a nontoken creature dies, you may exile that
          card.â A Chittering Host dies. As Mimic Vatâs triggered ability resolves, its controller makes a single choice
          and both cards that represented Chittering Host are either exiled or not.</p>

        <p>712.4d If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a melded permanent leaving the
          battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to one of the two cards
          affects both cards. If the melded permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rule 903.9a.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Leyline of the Void is an enchantment that reads, in part, âIf a card would be put into an
          opponentâs graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.â Wheel of Sun and Moon is an Aura with enchant player
          and the ability âIf a card would be put into enchanted playerâs graveyard from anywhere, instead that card is
          revealed and put on the bottom of its ownerâs library.â If the controller of Chittering Host is affected by
          both cardsâ effects, that player chooses one effect to apply to the event and Midnight Scavengers and Graf
          Rats are both moved to the appropriate zone.</p>

        <p>712.4e If an effect needs to know the number of objects that changed zones, a melded permanent among those
          objects counts as one object that moved. If the effect needs to know the number of cards that changed zones,
          that melded permanent counts as two cards that moved.</p>

        <p>712.5. Players who are allowed to look at a meld card may look at its half of the combined back face. Players
          may access Oracle text for the other member of the meld pair and the combined face at any time (see rule
          108.1).</p>

        <p>712.6. Meld cards in a playerâs deck may be represented by substitute cards. See rule 713, âSubstitute
          Cards.â</p>

        <p>712.7. If a meld card is cast as a spell, itâs put on the stack with its front face up. See rule 601,
          âCasting Spells.â</p>

        <p>712.8. A meld card enters the battlefield with its front face up unless itâs being melded with its
          counterpart.</p>

        <p>712.9. If an effect allows a player to cast a meld card as a face-down spell, or if a meld card enters the
          battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be
          face down. That card remains hidden, using either a face-down substitute card or opaque sleeves. See rule 707,
          âFace-Down Spells and Permanents.â</p>

        <p>712.10. Meld cards on the battlefield and melded permanents canât be turned face down. If a spell or ability
          tries to turn such a permanent face down, nothing happens.</p>

        <p>712.11. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may choose the name of a front face
          of a meld card or the combined back face of a meld pair.</p>

        <h2 id="713">
          713. Substitute Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>713.1. A substitute card is a game supplement that can be used to represent a double-faced card or meld card.
          A substitute card has a normal Magic card back.</p>

        <p>713.2. Each substitute card must clearly indicate the name of at least the front face of the card that it
          represents. Other information from the printed card (e.g. card type, mana cost, and power and toughness) may
          also be written on the substitute card.</p>

        <p>713.2a Some substitute cards list the names and mana costs of the cards they can represent. Exactly one of
          the fill-in circles must be marked to denote which card the substitute card represents. This style of
          substitute card was found in Magic products that released 2011â2018.</p>

        <p>713.2b Some substitute cards represent one specific listed card. This style of substitute card was found in
          the Core Set 2019 release, and it represents the card Nicol Bolas, the Ravager.</p>

        <p>713.2c Some substitute cards can represent any modal double-faced card. These substitute cards include the
          front-face and back-face symbols on the front face of the card. To use one of them, write in the name of each
          face of the card it represents. This style of substitute card is found in the Zendikar Rising release.</p>

        <p>713.3. If a substitute card is used in a deck, the card it represents is set aside prior to the beginning of
          the game (see rule 103.2a) and must remain available throughout the game. A substitute card canât be included
          in a deck unless it is representing a double-faced card or a meld card.</p>

        <p>713.4. For all game purposes, the substitute card is considered to be the card itâs representing.</p>

        <p>713.5. If the substitute card is face up in a public zone, it should be set aside and the double-faced card
          or meld card that it represents should be used instead.</p>

        <h2 id="714">
          714. Saga Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>714.1. Each Saga card has a striated text box containing a number of chapter symbols. Its illustration is
          vertically oriented on the right side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.</p>

        <p>714.2. A chapter symbol is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability referred to as a chapter
          ability.</p>

        <p>714.2a A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as â{rN}.â The numeral I represents 1, II
          represents 2, III represents 3, and so on.</p>

        <p>714.2b â{rN}â[Effect]â means âWhen one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore
          counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].â</p>

        <p>714.2c â{rN1}, {rN2}â[Effect]â means the same as â{rN1}â[Effect]â and â{rN2}â[Effect].â</p>

        <p>714.2d A Sagaâs final chapter number is the greatest value among chapter abilities it has. If a Saga somehow
          has no chapter abilities, its final chapter number is 0.</p>

        <p>714.3. Sagas use lore counters to track their progress.</p>

        <p>714.3a As a Saga enters the battlefield, its controller puts a lore counter on it.</p>

        <p>714.3b As a playerâs precombat main phase begins, that player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control.
          This turn-based action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <p>714.4. If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent is greater than or equal to its final chapter
          number, and it isnât the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that
          Sagaâs controller sacrifices it. This state-based action doesnât use the stack.</p>

        <h2 id="715">
          715. Adventurer Cards
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>715.1. Adventurer cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.</p>

        <p>715.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the
          object may have while itâs a spell. The cardâs normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller
          text box on the right.</p>

        <p>715.2a If an effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that âhas an Adventure,â it refers to an object for
          which these alternative characteristics exist, even if the object currently doesnât use them.</p>

        <p>715.2b The existence and values of these alternative characteristics is part of the objectâs copiable values.
        </p>

        <p>715.2c Although adventurer cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each adventurer card is
          only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded an adventurer card has drawn or discarded one
          card, not two.</p>

        <p>715.3. As a player casts an adventurer card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an
          Adventure.</p>

        <p>715.3a When casting an adventurer card as an Adventure, only the alternative characteristics are evaluated to
          see if it can be cast.</p>

        <p>715.3b While on the stack as an Adventure, the spell has only its alternative characteristics.</p>

        <p>715.3c If an Adventure spell is copied, the copy is also an Adventure. It has the alternative characteristics
          of the spell and not the normal characteristics of the card that represents the Adventure spell. Any rule or
          effect that refers to a spell cast as an Adventure refers to the copy as well.</p>

        <p>715.3d Instead of putting a spell that was cast as an Adventure into its ownerâs graveyard as it resolves,
          its controller exiles it. For as long as that card remains exiled, that player may cast it. It canât be cast
          as an Adventure this way, although other effects that allow a player to cast it may allow a player to cast it
          as an Adventure.</p>

        <p>715.4. In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Adventure, an adventurer card has
          only its normal characteristics.</p>

        <p>715.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an adventurer
          cardâs alternative name, the player may do so.</p>

        <h2 id="716">
          716. Controlling Another Player
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>716.1. Some cards allow a player to control another player during that playerâs next turn. This effect
          applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes. The affected player is controlled during the
          entire turn; the effect doesnât end until the beginning of the next turn.</p>

        <p>716.1a Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to
          be created is the one that works.</p>

        <p>716.1b If a turn is skipped, any pending player-controlling effects wait until the player who would be
          affected actually takes a turn.</p>

        <p>716.2. One card (Word of Command) allows a player to control another player for a limited duration.</p>

        <p>716.3. Only control of the player changes. All objects are controlled by their normal controllers. A player
          whoâs being controlled during their turn is still the active player.</p>

        <p>716.4. If information about an object in the game would be visible to the player being controlled, itâs
          visible to both that player and the controller of the player. If information about cards outside the game
          would be visible to the player being controlled, itâs visible only to that player, not the controller of the
          player.</p>
        <p>Example: The controller of a player can see that playerâs hand and the face of any face-down creatures they
          control.</p>

        <p>716.5. While controlling another player, a player makes all choices and decisions the controlled player is
          allowed to make or is told to make by the rules or by any objects. This includes choices and decisions about
          what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and abilities.</p>
        <p>Example: The controller of another player decides which spells that player casts and what those spells
          target, and makes any required decisions when those spells resolve.</p>
        <p>Example: The controller of another player decides which of that playerâs creatures attack, which player or
          planeswalker each one attacks, what the damage assignment order of the creatures that block them is (if any of
          the attacking creatures are blocked by multiple creatures), and how those attacking creatures assign their
          combat damage.</p>

        <p>716.5a The controller of another player can use only that playerâs resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay
          costs for that player.</p>
        <p>Example: If the controller of a player decides that the controlled player will cast a spell with an
          additional cost of discarding cards, the cards are discarded from the controlled playerâs hand.</p>

        <p>716.5b The controller of another player canât make choices or decisions for that player that arenât called
          for by the rules or by any objects. The controller also canât make any choices or decisions for the player
          that would be called for by the tournament rules.</p>
        <p>Example: The player whoâs being controlled still decides if they will leave to visit the restroom, trade a
          card to someone else, agree to an intentional draw, or call a judge about an error or infraction.</p>

        <p>716.6. The controller of another player canât make that player concede. A player may concede the game at any
          time, even if they are controlled by another player. See rule 104.3a.</p>

        <p>716.7. The effect that gives control of a player to another player may restrict the actions the controlled
          player is allowed to take or specify actions that the controlled player must take.</p>

        <p>716.8. A player who controls another player also continues to make their own choices and decisions.</p>

        <p>716.9. A player may gain control of themselves. That player will make their own decisions and choices as
          normal.</p>

        <h2 id="717">
          717. Ending Turns and Phases
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>717.1. Some cards end the turn. When an effect ends the turn, follow these steps in order, as they differ
          from the normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see rule 608, âResolving Spells and Abilitiesâ).
        </p>

        <p>717.1a If there are any triggered abilities that triggered before this process began but havenât been put
          onto the stack yet, those abilities cease to exist. They wonât be put onto the stack. This rule does not apply
          to abilities that trigger during this process (see rule 717.1f).</p>

        <p>717.1b Exile every object on the stack, including the object thatâs resolving. All objects not on the
          battlefield or in the command zone that arenât represented by cards will cease to exist the next time
          state-based actions are checked (see rule 704, âState-Based Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>717.1c Check state-based actions. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack.
        </p>

        <p>717.1d The current phase and/or step ends. If this happens during combat, remove all creatures and
          planeswalkers from combat. The game skips straight to the cleanup step; skip any phases or steps between this
          phase or step and the cleanup step. If an effect ends the turn during the cleanup step, a new cleanup step
          begins.</p>

        <p>717.1e Even though the turn ends, âat the beginning of the end stepâ triggered abilities donât trigger
          because the end step is skipped.</p>

        <p>717.1f No player gets priority during this process, so triggered abilities are not put onto the stack. If any
          triggered abilities have triggered since this process began, those abilities are put onto the stack during the
          cleanup step, then the active player gets priority and players can cast spells and activate abilities. Then
          there will be another cleanup step before the turn finally ends. If no triggered abilities have triggered
          during this process, no player gets priority during the cleanup step. See rule 514, âCleanup Step.â</p>

        <p>717.2. One card (Mandate of Peace) ends the combat phase. When an effect ends the combat phase, follow these
          steps in order, as they differ from the normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see rule 608,
          âResolving Spells and Abilitiesâ).</p>

        <p>717.2a If there are any triggered abilities that triggered before this process began but havenât been put
          onto the stack yet, those abilities cease to exist. They wonât be put onto the stack. This rule does not apply
          to abilities that trigger during this process (see rule 717.2f).</p>

        <p>717.2b Exile every object on the stack, including the object thatâs resolving. All objects not on the
          battlefield or in the command zone that arenât represented by cards will cease to exist the next time
          state-based actions are checked (see rule 704, âState-Based Actionsâ).</p>

        <p>717.2c Check state-based actions. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack.
        </p>

        <p>717.2d The current combat phase ends. Remove all creatures and planeswalkers from combat. Effects that last
          âuntil end of combatâ expire. The game skips straight to the next phase, usually the postcombat main phase;
          skip any steps between this step and that phase.</p>

        <p>717.2e Even though the combat phase ends, âat end of combatâ triggered abilities donât trigger because the
          end of combat step is skipped.</p>

        <p>717.2f No player gets priority during this process, so triggered abilities are not put onto the stack. If any
          triggered abilities have triggered since this process began, those abilities are put onto the stack during the
          following phase, then the active player gets priority and players can cast spells and activate abilities.</p>

        <p>717.2g If an effect attempts to end the combat phase at any time thatâs not a combat phase, nothing happens.

          718. The Monarch
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>718.1. The monarch is a designation a player can have. There is no monarch in a game until an effect
          instructs a player to become the monarch.</p>

        <p>718.2. There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered
          abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities
          triggered. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full texts of these abilities are âAt the beginning of the
          monarchâs end step, that player draws a cardâ and âWhenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its
          controller becomes the monarch.â</p>

        <p>718.3. Only one player can be the monarch at a time. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch
          ceases to be the monarch.</p>

        <p>718.4. If the monarch leaves the game, the active player becomes the monarch at the same time as that player
          leaves the game. If the active player is leaving the game or if there is no active player, the next player in
          turn order becomes the monarch.</p>

          719. Restarting the Game
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>719.1. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. A game that is restarted immediately ends. No players in
          that game win, lose, or draw that game. All players in that game when it ended then start a new game following
          the procedures set forth in rule 103, âStarting the Game,â with the following exception:</p>

        <p>719.1a The starting player in the new game is the player who controlled the spell or ability that restarted
          the game.</p>

        <p>719.2. All Magic cards involved in the game that was restarted when it ended, including phased-out permanents
          and nontraditional Magic cards, are involved in the new game, even if those cards were not originally involved
          in the restarted game. Ownership of cards in the new game doesnât change, regardless of their location when
          the new game begins.</p>
        <p>Example: A player casts Living Wish, bringing a creature card into the game from outside the game. Then that
          game is restarted. The creature card will be part of that playerâs library when the new game begins.</p>

        <p>719.3. Because each player draws seven cards when the new game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards
          in their library will lose the game when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first
          turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, âState-Based Actions.â)</p>

        <p>719.4. The effect that restarts the game finishes resolving just before the first turnâs untap step. If the
          spell or ability that generated that effect has additional instructions, those instructions are followed at
          this time. No player has priority, and any triggered abilities that trigger as a result will go on the stack
          the next time a player receives priority, usually during the first turnâs upkeep step.</p>

        <p>719.5. Effects may exempt certain cards from the procedure that restarts the game. These cards are not in
          their ownerâs deck as the new game begins.</p>

        <p>719.5a In a Commander game, a commander that has been exempted from the procedure that restarts the game
          wonât begin the new game in the command zone. However, it remains that deckâs commander for the new game. See
          rule 903, âCommander.â</p>

        <p>719.6. If a Magic subgame (see rule 720) is restarted, the main game is unaffected. Main-game effects that
          refer to the winner or loser of the subgame now refer to the winner or loser of the restarted subgame.</p>

        <p>719.7. If a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule 801) is restarted, all
          players in the game are involved, regardless of the range of influence of the player who controls the ability
          that restarted the game.</p>

        <h2 id="720">
          720. Subgames
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>720.1. One card (Shahrazad) allows players to play a Magic subgame.</p>

        <p>720.1a A âsubgameâ is a completely separate Magic game created by an effect. Essentially, itâs a game within
          a game. The âmain gameâ is the game in which the spell or ability that created the subgame was cast or
          activated. The main game is temporarily discontinued while the subgame is in progress. It resumes when the
          subgame ends.</p>

        <p>720.1b No effects or definitions created in either the main game or the subgame have any meaning in the
          other, except as defined by the effect that created the subgame. For example, the effect may say that
          something happens in the main game to the winner or loser of the subgame.</p>

        <p>720.2. As the subgame starts, an entirely new set of game zones is created. Each player takes all the cards
          in their main-game library, moves them to their subgame library, and shuffles them. No other cards in a
          main-game zone are moved to their corresponding subgame zone, except as specified in rules 720.2aâd. Randomly
          determine which player goes first. The subgame proceeds like a normal game, following all other rules in rule
          103, âStarting the Game.â</p>

        <p>720.2a As a subgame of a Planechase game starts, each player moves their planar deck from the main-game
          command zone to the subgame command zone and shuffles it. (Face-up plane and phenomenon cards remain in the
          main-game command zone.)</p>

        <p>720.2b As a subgame of a Vanguard game starts, each player moves their vanguard card from the main-game
          command zone to the subgame command zone.</p>

        <p>720.2c As a subgame of a Commander game starts, each player moves their commander from the main-game command
          zone (if itâs there) to the subgame command zone.</p>

        <p>720.2d As a subgame of an Archenemy game starts, the archenemy moves their scheme deck from the main-game
          command zone to the subgame command zone and shuffles it. (Face-up scheme cards remain in the main-game
          command zone.)</p>

        <p>720.3. Because each player draws seven cards when a game begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in
          their deck will lose the subgame when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep step of the first
          turn, regardless of any mulligans that player takes. (See rule 704, âState-Based Actions.â)</p>

        <p>720.4. All objects in the main game and all cards outside the main game are considered outside the subgame
          (except those specifically brought into the subgame). All players not currently in the subgame are considered
          outside the subgame.</p>

        <p>720.4a Some effects can bring cards into a game from outside of it. If a card is brought into a subgame from
          a main game, abilities in the main game that trigger on objects leaving a main-game zone will trigger, but
          they wonât be put onto the stack until the main game resumes.</p>

        <p>720.4b A playerâs main-game counters arenât considered part of the subgame, although the player will still
          have them when the main game resumes. Similarly, any counters a player gets during a subgame will cease to
          exist when the subgame ends.</p>

        <p>720.5. At the end of a subgame, each player takes all cards they own that are in the subgame other than those
          in the subgame command zone, puts them into their main-game library, then shuffles them. This includes cards
          in the subgameâs exile zone. Except as specified in rules 720.5aâd, all other objects in the subgame cease to
          exist, as do the zones created for the subgame. The main game continues from the point at which it was
          discontinued: First, the spell or ability that created the subgame finishes resolving, even if it was created
          by a spell card thatâs no longer on the stack. Then, if any main-game abilities triggered while the subgame
          was in progress due to cards being removed from the main game, those abilities are put onto the stack.</p>
        <p>Example: If a card was brought into the subgame either from the main game or from outside the main game, that
          card will be put into its ownerâs main-game library when the subgame ends.</p>

        <p>720.5a At the end of a subgame of a Planechase game, each face-up plane card or phenomenon card is turned
          face down and put on the bottom of its ownerâs planar deck. Then each player moves their planar deck from the
          subgame command zone to the main-game command zone and shuffles it.</p>

        <p>720.5b At the end of a subgame of a Vanguard game, each player moves their vanguard card from the subgame
          command zone to the main-game command zone. This is an exception to rule 311.2.</p>

        <p>720.5c At the end of a subgame of a Commander game, each player moves their commander from the subgame
          command zone (if itâs there) to the main-game command zone.</p>

        <p>720.5d At the end of a subgame of an Archenemy game, any face-up scheme cards in the subgame command zone are
          turned face down and put on the bottom of their ownerâs scheme deck. Then the archenemy moves their scheme
          deck from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone and shuffles it.</p>

        <p>720.6. A subgame can be created within a subgame. The existing subgame becomes the main game in relation to
          the new subgame.</p>

        <h2 id="721">
          721. Merging with Permanents
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>721.1. One keyword causes an object to merge with a permanent. See rule 702.139, âMutate.â</p>

        <p>721.2. To merge an object with a permanent, place that object on top of or under that permanent. That
          permanent becomes a merged permanent represented by the card that represented that object in addition to any
          other components that were representing it.</p>

        <p>721.2a A merged permanent has only the characteristics of its topmost component, unless otherwise specified
          by the effect that caused them to merge. This is a copiable effect whose timestamp is the time the objects
          merged. (See rule 613.2.)</p>

        <p>721.2b As an object merges with a permanent, that object leaves its previous zone and becomes part of an
          object on the battlefield, but the resulting permanent isnât considered to have just entered the battlefield.
        </p>

        <p>721.2c Because a merged permanent is the same object that it was before, it hasnât just come under a playerâs
          control, any continuous effects that affected it continue to do so, and so on.</p>

        <p>721.2d If a merged permanent contains a token, the resulting permanent is a token only if the topmost
          component is a token.</p>

        <p>721.2e If a merged permanent contains face-up and face-down components, the permanentâs status is determined
          by its topmost component. If a face-down permanent becomes a face-up permanent as a result of an object
          merging with it, other effects donât count it as being turned face up.</p>

        <p>721.2f If a merged permanent is turned face down, each face-up component that represents it is turned face
          down. If a face-down merged permanent is turned face up, each face-down component that represents it is turned
          face up.</p>

        <p>721.2g A face-down merged permanent that contains an instant or sorcery card canât be turned face up. If such
          a permanent would turn face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger when
          a permanent is turned face up wonât trigger.</p>

        <p>721.2h If a merged permanent contains a flip card (see rule 709), that componentâs alternative
          characteristics are used instead of its normal characteristics if the merged permanent is flipped.</p>

        <p>721.2i If a merged permanent contains one or more transforming double-faced cards (see rule 711),
          transforming that permanent causes each of those double-faced cards to turn so that its other face is up.</p>

        <p>721.2j A face-up merged permanent that contains a double-faced card or meld card canât be turned face down.
        </p>

        <p>721.3. If a merged permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and each of the
          individual components are put into the appropriate zone.</p>

        <p>721.3a If a merged permanent is put into its ownerâs graveyard or library, that player may arrange the new
          objects in any order. If itâs put into its ownerâs library, that player doesnât reveal the order.</p>

        <p>721.3b If a player exiles a merged permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the
          cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 613.7k.</p>

        <p>721.3c If an effect can find the new object that a merged permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it
          finds all of those objects. (See rule 400.7.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those objects,
          the same actions are taken upon each of them.</p>

        <p>721.3d If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a merged permanent leaving the
          battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to the object applies it
          to all components of the object. If the merged permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see
          rule 903.9a.</p>

        <p>721.3e If a replacement effect applies to a âcardâ being put into a zone without also including tokens, that
          effect applies to all components of the merged permanent if itâs not a token, including components that are
          tokens. If the merged permanent is a token but some of its components are cards, the merged permanent and its
          token components are put into the appropriate zone, and the components that are cards are moved by the
          replacement effect.</p>

          722. Taking Shortcuts
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>722.1. When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually understood shortcuts rather than
          explicitly identifying each game choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.</p>

        <p>722.1a The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands
          the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable.</p>

        <p>722.1b Occasionally the game gets into a state in which a set of actions could be repeated indefinitely (thus
          creating a âloopâ). In that case, the shortcut rules can be used to determine how many times those actions are
          repeated without having to actually perform them, and how the loop is broken.</p>

        <p>722.1c Tournaments use a modified version of the rules governing shortcuts and loops. These rules are covered
          in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). Whenever
          the Tournament Rules contradict these rules during a tournament, the Tournament Rules take precedence.</p>

        <p>722.2. Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.</p>

        <p>722.2a At any point in the game, the player with priority may suggest a shortcut by describing a sequence of
          game choices, for all players, that may be legally taken based on the current game state and the predictable
          results of the sequence of choices. This sequence may be a non-repetitive series of choices, a loop that
          repeats a specified number of times, multiple loops, or nested loops, and may even cross multiple turns. It
          canât include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event determines the next action a player
          takes. The ending point of this sequence must be a place where a player has priority, though it need not be
          the player proposing the shortcut.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls a creature enchanted by Presence of Gond, which grants the creature the ability
          â{T}: Create a 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token,â and another player controls Intruder Alarm, which reads,
          in part, âWhenever a creature enters the battlefield, untap all creatures.â When the player has priority, they
          may suggest âIâll create a million tokens,â indicating the sequence of activating the creatureâs ability, all
          players passing priority, letting the creatureâs ability resolve and create a token (which causes Intruder
          Alarmâs ability to trigger), Intruder Alarmâs controller putting that triggered ability on the stack, all
          players passing priority, Intruder Alarmâs triggered ability resolving, all players passing priority until the
          player proposing the shortcut has priority, and repeating that sequence 999,999 more times, ending just after
          the last token-creating ability resolves.</p>

        <p>722.2b Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who suggested the shortcut, may either
          accept the proposed sequence, or shorten it by naming a place where they will make a game choice thatâs
          different than whatâs been proposed. (The player doesnât need to specify at this time what the new choice will
          be.) This place becomes the new ending point of the proposed sequence.</p>
        <p>Example: The active player draws a card during her draw step, then says, âGo.â The nonactive player is
          holding Into the Fray (an instant that says âTarget creature attacks this turn if ableâ) and says, âIâd like
          to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step.â The current proposed shortcut is that all players pass
          priority at all opportunities during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the beginning of
          combat step.</p>

        <p>722.2c Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken.
          The game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal
          having been taken. If the shortcut was shortened from the original proposal, the player who now has priority
          must make a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player.</p>

        <p>722.3. Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player involved in the loop performs an
          independent action that results in the same game state being reached multiple times. If that happens, the
          active player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first player in turn order who is
          involved) must then make a different game choice so the loop does not continue.</p>
        <p>Example: In a two-player game, the active player controls a creature with the ability â{0}: [This creature]
          gains flying,â the nonactive player controls a permanent with the ability â{0}: Target creature loses flying,â
          and nothing in the game cares how many times an ability has been activated. Say the active player activates
          his creatureâs ability, it resolves, then the nonactive player activates her permanentâs ability targeting
          that creature, and it resolves. This returns the game to a game state it was at before. The active player must
          make a different game choice (in other words, anything other than activating that creatureâs ability again).
          The creature doesnât have flying. Note that the nonactive player could have prevented the fragmented loop
          simply by not activating her permanentâs ability, in which case the creature would have had flying. The
          nonactive player always has the final choice and is therefore able to determine whether the creature has
          flying.</p>

        <p>722.4. If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw. (See rules 104.4b and 104.4f.)</p>

        <p>722.5. No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop other than actions called for by
          objects involved in the loop.</p>
        <p>Example: A player controls Seal of Cleansing, an enchantment that reads, âSacrifice Seal of Cleansing:
          Destroy target artifact or enchantment.â A mandatory loop that involves an artifact begins. The player is not
          forced to sacrifice Seal of Cleansing to destroy the artifact and end the loop.</p>

        <p>722.6. If a loop contains an effect that says â[A] unless [B],â where [A] and [B] are each actions, no player
          can be forced to perform [B] to break the loop. If no player chooses to perform [B], the loop will continue as
          though [A] were mandatory.</p>

        <h2 id="723">
          723. Handling Illegal Actions
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>723.1. If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but canât legally complete it, the
          entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects
          apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it
          came from. Each player may also reverse any legal mana abilities that player activated while making the
          illegal play, unless mana from those abilities or from any triggered mana abilities they caused to trigger was
          spent on another mana ability that wasnât reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a
          library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or
          caused cards from a library to be revealed.</p>

        <p>723.2. When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take
          another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action
          allowed by the rules.</p>

        <p>800.2. These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of
          variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.</p>

        <p>800.3. Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck
          construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be
          found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.</p>

        <p>800.4. Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.
        </p>

        <p>800.4a When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and any
          effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any
          objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects
          still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as
          soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left,
          priority passes to the next player in turn order whoâs still in the game.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, âYou control enchanted creature,â on Biancaâs Assault
          Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Biancaâs control. If,
          instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alexâs graveyard.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, âGain control of target creature until end of
          turn,â targeting Biancaâs Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treasonâs change-of-control effect
          ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Biancaâs control.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, âSearch target opponentâs library for a creature card and put that
          card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,â targeting Bianca. Alex
          puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Biancaâs library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also
          leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, âWhenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if
          Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creatureâs controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.â
          If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alexâs control leave the game,
          and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other playerâs control remain in the game.</p>

        <p>800.4b If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesnât. If a token
          would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would
          be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object
          remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they arenât.
        </p>

        <p>800.4c If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect
          giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by
          default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the
          control-changing effect ends.</p>

        <p>800.4d If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it
          isnât created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put
          onto the stack, it isnât put on the stack.</p>
        <p>Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, âWhenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target
          creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its ownerâs control at the beginning of the
          next end step.â During Alexâs turn, Bianca uses Astral Slideâs ability to exile Alexâs Hypnotic Specter.
          Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered
          ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isnât
          put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield.</p>

        <p>800.4e If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isnât assigned.</p>

        <p>800.4f If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the controller of the object
          chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the
          controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.</p>

        <p>800.4g If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order
          makes that choice.</p>

        <p>800.4h If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information
          about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about
          that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players
          have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game.</p>

        <p>800.4i If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active
          player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority,
          or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.</p>

        <p>800.4j If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesnât begin.</p>

        <p>800.4k When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that playerâs
          next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither
          expire immediately nor last indefinitely.</p>

        <p>800.4m When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This
          is an exception to rule 800.4a. See rule 407, âAnte.â</p>

        <p>800.4n In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead
          the next player in turn order that wouldnât leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar
          controller leaves the game. See rule 309.5.</p>

        <p>800.5. Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually
          agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice
          to determine seating order, and so on.</p>

        <p>800.6. In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesnât count toward the number of cards that
          player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent
          mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>

        <p>800.7. In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesnât skip the draw
          step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their
          first turn. See rule 103.7.</p>

        <h2 id="801">
          801. Limited Range of Influence Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>801.1. Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. Itâs always
          used in the Emperor variant (see rule 809), and itâs often used for games involving five or more players.</p>

        <p>801.2. A playerâs range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that
          the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that playerâs range of
          influence. Objects controlled by players within a playerâs range of influence are also within that playerâs
          range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making
          choices, and winning the game.</p>

        <p>801.2a The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may
          have different ranges of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within
          your range of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to
          your right are within your range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.2b A player is always within their own range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.2c The particular players within each playerâs range of influence are determined as each turn begins.</p>
        <p>Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated
          to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alexâs range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter
          Alexâs range of influence at the start of the next turn.</p>

        <p>801.2d An object is within a playerâs range of influence if itâs controlled by that player or by another
          player within that many seats of that player.</p>

        <p>801.3. Creatures can attack only opponents within their controllerâs range of influence or planeswalkers
          controlled by those opponents. If no opponents are within a playerâs range of influence, creatures that player
          controls canât attack.</p>

        <p>801.4. Objects and players outside a playerâs range of influence canât be the targets of spells or abilities
          that player controls.</p>

        <p>801.5. Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of
          influence option is used.</p>

        <p>801.5a If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of
          influence.</p>
        <p>Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the
          ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, â{T}: Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to
          any target of an opponentâs choice,â targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other
          target. Rob must choose a target thatâs in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the
          controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either
          himself or Alex.</p>

        <p>801.5b If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or
          players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the
          playerâs range of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range
          of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, âAn opponent chooses one â
          You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,â and chooses Carissa to make
          that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.</p>

        <p>801.5c If an effect requires a choice and thereâs no player who can make that choice within its controllerâs
          range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controllerâs left makes that choice.</p>
        <p>Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction,
          which reads, âReveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put
          one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.â Since no opponent is within the emperorâs range of
          influence, the nearest opponent to the emperorâs left separates the cards into piles.</p>

        <p>801.6. A player canât activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.7. A triggered ability doesnât trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of
          influence of its sourceâs controller.</p>
        <p>Example: In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob
          controls two Auras attached to Alexâs Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition âWhenever enchanted
          creature becomes blocked,â and one with the trigger condition âWhenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by
          a creature.â Alexâs Runeclaw Bear attacks the player to Alexâs left and becomes blocked. The ability of Robâs
          first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes blocked) happens within Robâs range of
          influence. The ability of Robâs second Aura doesnât trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking
          creature, which is out of Robâs range.</p>

        <p>801.7a If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a playerâs range of influence, use the
          game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger.
          See rules 603.6 and 603.10.</p>
        <p>Example: Carissa and Alex are outside each otherâs range of influence. Carissa controls a Runeclaw Bear owned
          by Alex and they each control an Extractor Demon, a creature which reads, in part, âWhenever another creature
          leaves the battlefield, you may have target player mill two cards.â The Runeclaw Bear is destroyed and is put
          into Alexâs graveyard. The ability of Alexâs Extractor Demon doesnât trigger because the
          leaves-the-battlefield event was outside Alexâs range of influence. The ability of Carissaâs Extractor Demon
          does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the
          leaves-the-battlefield event was within her range.</p>

        <p>801.8. An Aura canât enchant an object or player outside its controllerâs range of influence. If an Aura is
          attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its ownerâs graveyard as a state-based action.
          See rule 704.</p>

        <p>801.9. An Equipment canât equip an object outside its controllerâs range of influence, and a Fortification
          canât fortify an object outside its controllerâs range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is
          attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield.
          This is a state-based action. See rule 704.</p>

        <p>801.10. Spells and abilities canât affect objects or players outside their controllerâs range of influence.
          The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of
          the effect will work normally.</p>
        <p>Example: In a six-player game in which each player has range of influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which
          reads, âPyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.â Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by
          Alex, the player to Alexâs left, and the player to Alexâs right. No other creatures are dealt damage.</p>

        <p>801.11. If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its
          controllerâs range of influence. It doesnât see objects or events outside its controllerâs range of influence.
        </p>
        <p>Example: In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which
          reads, âEach creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature
          type with it.â Coat of Arms will boost Alexâs creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex,
          the player to Alexâs left, and the player to Alexâs right. It wonât take other creatures into account.</p>
        <p>Example: In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex. Coat of Arms will boost Robâs creatures based
          on what creatures are controlled by players within Alexâs range of influence, including the player sitting to
          Alexâs left, whoâs out of Robâs range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.12. The âworld ruleâ (see rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within
          its controllerâs range of influence.</p>

        <p>801.13. Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or
          partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain
          instructions that canât be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions.
          See rule 614, âReplacement Effects,â and rule 615, âPrevention Effects.â</p>

        <p>801.13a If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its
          controllerâs range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.</p>
        <p>Example: Alex casts Lava Axe (âLava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker.â) targeting Rob. In
          response, Rob casts Captainâs Maneuver (âThe next X damage that would be dealt to target creature,
          planeswalker, or player this turn is dealt to another target creature, planeswalker, or player instead.â) with
          X equal to 3, targeting Carissa. Carissa isnât in Alexâs range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals
          2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.</p>

        <p>801.13b If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can
          affect only sources within the spell or abilityâs controllerâs range of influence. If a spell or ability
          creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only
          permanents and players within the spell or abilityâs controllerâs range of influence. If a spell or ability
          creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is
          specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or
          abilityâs controllerâs range of influence.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob is within Alexâs range of influence, but Carissa is not. Alex controls an enchantment that says,
          âPrevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures.â Carissa attacks Rob with a creature. The creature deals
          combat damage to Rob.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob is within Alexâs range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa casts Lightning Blast
          (âLightning Blast deals 4 damage to any target.â) targeting Rob. In response, Alex casts Mending Hands
          (âPrevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.â) targeting Rob. The damage to Rob is
          prevented.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob is within Alexâs range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa attacks Rob with a creature,
          and Rob blocks with a creature. Alex casts Fog (âPrevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.â)
          Carissa and Robâs creatures deal combat damage to each other.</p>

        <p>801.14. If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that playerâs opponents within that playerâs
          range of influence lose the game instead.</p>

        <p>801.15. If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell
          or abilityâs controller and all players within that playerâs range of influence. They leave the game. All
          remaining players continue to play the game.</p>

        <p>801.16. If the game somehow enters a âloopâ of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way
          to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object thatâs involved in that loop, as well as
          for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining
          players continue to play the game.</p>

        <p>801.17. Effects that restart the game (see rule 719) are exempt from the limited range of influence option.
          All players in the game will be involved in the new game.</p>

        <p>801.18. In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are
          exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect
          all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule 901, âPlanechase.â</p>

        <h2 id="802">
          802. Attack Multiple Players Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>802.1. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is
          used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.</p>

        <p>802.2. As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesnât choose an opponent to become the defending
          player. Instead, all the attacking playerâs opponents are defending players during the combat phase.</p>

        <p>802.2a Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a âdefending playerâ refers to one specific defending
          player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending
          player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless
          otherwise specified, the defending player itâs referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the
          controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the
          defending player itâs referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat
          or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a
          spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually
          determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be
          chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.</p>
        <p>Example: Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a creature with mountainwalk. Whether
          the creature with mountainwalk can be blocked depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.</p>

        <p>802.3. As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player or a
          planeswalker controlled by a defending player for it to attack. See rule 508, âDeclare Attackers Step.â</p>

        <p>802.3a Restrictions and requirements that donât apply to attacking a specific player are evaluated based on
          the entire group of attacking creatures. Restrictions and requirements that apply to attacking a specific
          player apply only to creatures attacking that player. The entire group of attacking creatures must still be
          legal. See rule 508.1.</p>

        <p>802.3b Creatures in a band canât attack different players. See rule 702.21, âBanding.â</p>

        <p>802.4. If more than one player is being attacked or controls a planeswalker thatâs being attacked, each
          defending player in APNAP order declares blockers as the declare blockers step begins. (See rule 101.4 and
          rule 509, âDeclare Blockers Step.â) The first defending player declares all their blocks, then the second
          defending player, and so on.</p>

        <p>802.4a A defending player can block only with creatures they control. Those creatures can block only
          creatures attacking that player or a planeswalker that player controls.</p>

        <p>802.4b When determining whether a defending playerâs blocks are legal, ignore any creatures attacking other
          players and any blocking creatures controlled by other players.</p>

        <p>802.5. After blockers have been declared, if any creatures are blocking multiple creatures, each defending
          player in APNAP order announces the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures for each blocking
          creature they control. See rule 510, âCombat Damage Step.â</p>

        <p>802.6. Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order. Other than that, the combat damage step proceeds just as in
          a two-player game. See rule 510, âCombat Damage Step.â</p>

          803. Attack Left and Attack Right Options
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>803.1. Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.</p>

        <p>803.1a If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their
          left. If a playerâs nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player canât attack.</p>

        <p>803.1b If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their
          right. If a playerâs nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player canât attack.</p>

        <h2 id="804">
          804. Deploy Creatures Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>804.1. The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that
          allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually donât
          use this option.</p>

        <p>804.2. Each creature has the ability â{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate this
          ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.â</p>

        <h2 id="805">
          805. Shared Team Turns Option
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>805.1. Some multiplayer games between teams use the shared team turns option. Itâs always used in the
          Two-Headed Giant variant (see rule 810) and the Archenemy casual variant (see rule 904). It can be used only
          if the members of each team are sitting in adjacent seats.</p>

        <p>805.2. Within each team, the player seated in the rightmost seat from that teamâs perspective is the primary
          player. If the players on a team canât agree on a choice, such as which creatures attack or what order
          triggered abilities are put on the stack, the primary player makes that choice.</p>

        <p>805.3. The methods described in rule 103.1 are used to determine which team will take the first turn. The
          team determined this way is the starting team.</p>

        <p>805.3a The process for handling mulligans is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in
          whatever order that team likes, declares whether that player will take a mulligan. Then the players on each
          other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans
          are taken at the same time. Teammates may consult while choosing which cards, if any, to put on the bottom of
          their library. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand. See
          rule 103.4.</p>

        <p>805.3b The process for handling cards that allow a player to begin the game with them on the battlefield is
          altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, may put any
          or all such cards onto the battlefield from that playerâs opening hand. Teammates may consult while making
          their decisions. Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>805.4. Each team takes turns rather than each player.</p>

        <p>805.4a The team whose turn it is is the active team. Each other team is a nonactive team.</p>

        <p>805.4b Each player on a team draws a card during that teamâs draw step.</p>

        <p>805.4c Each player on a team may play a land during each of that teamâs turns.</p>

        <p>805.4d An ability that triggers at the beginning of a step or phase may trigger multiple times if it triggers
          at the beginning of âeach playerâsâ or âeach opponentâsâ step or phase. These abilities trigger once for each
          appropriate player if the abilityâs trigger condition, effect, or intervening âifâ clause refers to âthat
          player,â âthat opponent,â or similar.</p>

        <p>805.5. Teams have priority, not individual players.</p>

        <p>805.5a A player may cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action when their team has priority.
        </p>

        <p>805.5b If a team has priority and no player on that team wishes to do anything, that team passes. If all
          teams pass in succession (that is, if all teams pass without any player taking any actions in between
          passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives priority. If the stack is empty
          when all teams pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.</p>

        <p>805.6. The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 101.4) is modified if the shared team turns
          option is used. If multiple teams would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active
          team makes any choices required, then each nonactive team in turn order makes any choices required. If
          multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first each player on the active team
          makes any choices required in whatever order they like, then the players on each nonactive team in turn order
          do the same. Once all choices have been made, the actions happen simultaneously.</p>

        <p>805.6a If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a game thatâs using the shared team turns
          option, first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs that playerâs draws,
          then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.</p>

        <p>805.7. If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time a team received priority, the
          members of the active team put all triggered abilities any of them controls on the stack in any order they
          choose, then the members of each nonactive team in turn order do the same.</p>

        <p>805.8. If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that playerâs turn, that playerâs
          team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that
          playerâs team does so. If a single effect causes more than one player on the same team to add or skip the same
          step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips only that step, phase, or turn. If an effect causes a player to
          control another player, the first player controls the affected playerâs team.</p>

        <p>805.9. Any ability that refers to the âactive playerâ refers to one specific active player, not to all of the
          active players. The abilityâs controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is
          applied.</p>

        <p>805.10. The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.</p>

        <p>805.10a Each teamâs creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is
          the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is
          the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.</p>

        <p>805.10b As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. For each attacking
          creature, the attacking team announces which defending player or planeswalker that creature is attacking. The
          active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule
          508.1.</p>

        <p>805.10c Any rule, object, or effect that refers to an âattacking playerâ refers to one specific attacking
          player, not to all attacking players. If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a
          spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified,
          the attacking player itâs referring to is the player who controls the attacking creature that blocking
          creature is blocking. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate
          attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple
          attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.</p>

        <p>805.10d As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by
          the defending players can block creatures attacking any player on the defending team or attacking a
          planeswalker controlled by one of those players. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of
          blocking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 509.1.</p>

        <p>805.10e Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a âdefending playerâ refers to one specific defending
          player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending
          player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless
          otherwise specified, the defending player itâs referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the
          controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the
          defending player itâs referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat
          or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a
          spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually
          determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be
          chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.</p>

        <p>805.10f Once blockers have been declared, for each attacking creature thatâs become blocked by multiple
          creatures, the active team announces the damage assignment order among the blocking creatures. Then, for each
          creature thatâs blocking multiple creatures, the defending team announces the damage assignment order among
          the attacking creatures.</p>

        <p>805.10g As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign
          its combat damage. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage.
          See rule 510.1.</p>

          806. Free-for-All Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>806.1. In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as individuals against each other.</p>

        <p>806.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Free-for-All variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>806.2a The limited range of influence option usually isnât used in Free-for-All games. If it is, each player
          has the same range of influence, which is determined before play begins. See rule 801, âLimited Range of
          Influence Option.â</p>

        <p>806.2b Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See
          rule 803, âAttack Left and Attack Right Options,â and rule 802, âAttack Multiple Players Option.â</p>

        <p>806.2c The deploy creatures option isnât used in the Free-for-All variant.</p>

        <p>806.3. The players are randomly seated around the table.</p>

        <h2 id="807">
          807. Grand Melee Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>807.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players
          compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more
          players.</p>

        <p>807.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>807.2a Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 801).</p>

        <p>807.2b The attack left option is used (see rule 803).</p>

        <p>807.2c The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options arenât used in the Grand Melee variant.</p>

        <p>807.3. The players are seated at random.</p>

        <p>807.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers
          keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active playerâs turn.
        </p>

        <p>807.4a There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.</p>
        <p>Example: A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers. A game with fifteen players has three
          turn markers.</p>

        <p>807.4b The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that playerâs
          left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed
          out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns
          at the same time.</p>

        <p>807.4c After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a
          player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker
          after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to
          their left takes the turn marker immediately.</p>

        <p>807.4d A player who receives a turn marker canât begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their
          left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes
          the other turn marker.</p>

        <p>807.4e If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers
          in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed playerâs right is designated for removal. If more
          than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn
          markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest
          number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.</p>

        <p>807.4f For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of
          turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.</p>

        <p>807.4g If a player whoâs taking a turn has a turn marker thatâs been designated for removal, that turn marker
          is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player whoâs not taking a turn has a turn
          marker thatâs been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker
          had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal
          that many times minus one.</p>

        <p>807.4h If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of
          those seats donât enter one anotherâs range of influence until the next turn begins.</p>

        <p>807.4i If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that
          player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn
          marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the playerâs left,
          the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn
          marker is within three seats on the playerâs right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the
          turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.
        </p>

        <p>807.4j If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player
          wouldnât have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before
          their next turn instead.</p>
        <p>Example: During Alexâs turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one.
          During the same turn, the player to Alexâs left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be
          reduced. After Alexâs current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He wonât take the extra turn from Time
          Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker.</p>

        <p>807.5. Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker
          represents its own stack.</p>

        <p>807.5a A player gets priority for a particular turn markerâs stack only if the turn marker is within their
          range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.</p>

        <p>807.5b If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered
          ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put
          on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on
          that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a
          copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one
          of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it canât target objects on multiple stacks.
        </p>

          808. Team vs. Team Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>808.1. Team vs. Team games are played with two or more teams. Each team may have any number of players on it.
        </p>

        <p>808.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players
          sit.</p>

        <p>808.3. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Team vs. Team variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>808.3a The attack multiple players option is used (see rule 802).</p>

        <p>808.3b The deploy creatures options and limited range of influence options usually arenât used in the Team
          vs. Team variant.</p>

        <p>808.4. To determine which player goes first, randomly choose a team. If that team has an odd number of
          players, the player in its center seat goes first. If that team has an even number of players, the player to
          the left of its midpoint goes first. Turn order goes to the playersâ left.</p>

        <p>808.5. In the Team vs. Team variant, a teamâs resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared.
          Teammates may review each otherâs hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates canât manipulate each
          otherâs cards or permanents.</p>

        <h2 id="809">
          809. Emperor Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>809.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.</p>

        <p>809.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which itâs seated.
          Each team has one emperor, who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals
          whose job is to protect the emperor.</p>

        <p>809.3. The Emperor variant uses the following default options.</p>

        <p>809.3a The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for generals. See rule 801, âLimited Range
          of Influence Option.â</p>

        <p>809.3b Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 804).</p>

        <p>809.3c A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to them.</p>
        <p>Example: At the start of an Emperor game, neither emperor can attack any opponents, even though both of the
          opposing generals are within their spell range.</p>

        <p>809.4. Randomly determine which emperor goes first. Turn order goes to the playersâ left.</p>

        <p>809.5. The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for winning and losing the game. All other
          rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)</p>

        <p>809.5a A team wins the game if its emperor wins.</p>

        <p>809.5b A team loses the game if its emperor loses.</p>

        <p>809.5c The game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor.</p>

        <p>809.6. The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more
          than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.</p>

        <p>809.6a Each generalâs range of influence should be the minimum number that allows one general from an
          opposing team to begin the game within their range of influence. Each emperorâs range of influence should be
          the minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the game within their range of
          influence. Players should be seated such that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of
          another emperor.</p>
        <p>Example: In an Emperor game between two teams of four players each, the player configuration (either
          clockwise or counterclockwise around the table) should be: Team A general 1, Team A emperor, Team A general 2,
          Team A general 3, Team B general 1, Team B emperor, Team B general 2, Team B general 3. Each emperor has range
          of influence 3. Each general 2 has range of influence 2. Each general 1 and general 3 has range of influence
          1.</p>

        <p>809.7. In the Emperor variant, a teamâs resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates
          may review each otherâs hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates canât manipulate each otherâs

          810. Two-Headed Giant Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>810.1. Two-Headed Giant games are played with two teams of two players each.</p>

        <p>810.2. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the shared team turns option. (See rule 805.)</p>

        <p>810.3. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which its players
          sit.</p>

        <p>810.4. Each team has a shared life total, which starts at 30 life.</p>

        <p>810.5. With the exception of life total and poison counters, a teamâs resources (cards in hand, mana, and so
          on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant. Teammates may review each otherâs hands and discuss
          strategies at any time. Teammates canât manipulate each otherâs cards or permanents.</p>

        <p>810.6. The team who plays first skips the draw step of its first turn.</p>

        <p>810.7. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the combat rules for the shared team turns option (see rule 805.10).
          This is a change from previous rules.</p>

        <p>810.8. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 104), with
          the following additions and specifications.</p>

        <p>810.8a Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the
          game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an
          effect says that a player canât win the game, that playerâs team canât win the game. If an effect says that a
          player canât lose the game, that playerâs team canât lose the game.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence, which reads, in part, âYou donât lose
          the game for having 0 or less life.â If that playerâs teamâs life total is 0 or less, that team doesnât lose
          the game.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card while there are no cards in that
          playerâs library. That player loses the game, so that playerâs entire team loses the game.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel, which reads, âYou canât lose the game
          and your opponents canât win the game.â Neither that player nor their teammate can lose the game while
          Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the opposing team can win the game.</p>

        <p>810.8b If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.</p>

        <p>810.8c If a teamâs life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule
          704.)</p>

        <p>810.8d If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based
          action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>810.9. Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to
          the teamâs shared life total.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which reads, âFlame Rift deals 4 damage to
          each player.â Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.</p>

        <p>810.9a If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual playerâs life total, that cost or effect
          uses the teamâs life total instead.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 17 life is targeted by Beacon of
          Immortality, which reads, in part, âDouble target playerâs life total.â That player gains 17 life, so the team
          winds up at 34 life.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, âAt the
          beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.â At the beginning of that playerâs
          upkeep, the playerâs team wins the game if their teamâs life total is 50 or more.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 11 life controls Lurking Evil, an
          enchantment that reads, âPay half your life, rounded up: Lurking Evil becomes a 4/4 Horror creature with
          flying.â To activate the ability, that player must pay 6 life. The team winds up at 5 life.</p>

        <p>810.9b If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life
          they pay may not exceed their teamâs life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)</p>

        <p>810.9c If an effect sets a single playerâs life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the
          necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The teamâs life total is adjusted by the amount of life
          that player gained or lost.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life is targeted by an ability that
          reads, âTarget playerâs life total becomes 10.â That playerâs life total is considered to be 25, so that
          player loses 15 life. The team winds up at 10 life.</p>

        <p>810.9d If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of
          its members. On that team, only that player is affected.</p>
        <p>Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, one team has 7 life and the other team has 13 life. A player casts Repay
          in Kind, which reads, âEach playerâs life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.â Each team
          chooses one of its members to be affected. The result is that the chosen player on the team that has 13 life
          loses 6 life, so that teamâs life total winds up at 7.</p>

        <p>810.9e A player canât exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the
          exchange wonât happen.</p>

        <p>810.9f If an effect instructs a player to redistribute any number of playersâ life totals, that player may
          not affect more than one member of each team this way.</p>

        <p>810.9g If an effect says that a player canât gain life, no player on that playerâs team can gain life.</p>

        <p>810.9h If an effect says that a player canât lose life, no player on that playerâs team can lose life or pay
          any amount of life other than 0.</p>

        <p>810.10. Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison
          counters are shared by the team.</p>

        <p>810.10a If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the
          number of poison counters that playerâs team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a
          playerâs opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.</p>

        <p>810.10b If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that playerâs team loses that many poison
          counters.</p>

        <p>810.10c If an effect says that a player canât get poison counters, no player on that playerâs team can get
          poison counters.</p>

        <p>810.10d If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses
          the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that playerâs team has. A player is âpoisonedâ
          if that playerâs team has one or more poison counters.</p>

        <p>810.11. The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players.
          For each player a team has beyond the second, that teamâs starting life total is increased by 15 and the
          number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called
          Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)</p>

          811. Alternating Teams Variant
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>811.1. Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.</p>

        <p>811.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the
          following default options.</p>

        <p>811.2a The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule 801, âLimited Range of Influence Option.â</p>

        <p>811.2b Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See
          rule 803, âAttack Left and Attack Right Options,â and rule 802, âAttack Multiple Players Option.â</p>

        <p>811.2c The deploy creatures option isnât normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.</p>

        <p>811.3. At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is
          equally spaced out.</p>
        <p>Example: In an Alternating Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around the table at the
          start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, and so on.</p>

        <p>811.4. A player canât attack opponents who arenât seated next to them.</p>

        <p>811.5. In the Alternating Teams variant, a teamâs resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared.
          Teammates canât review each otherâs hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss
          strategies at any time. Teammates canât manipulate each otherâs cards or permanents.</p>

        <h2 id="900">
          900. General
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>900.1. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for certain casual game variants. It
          is by no means comprehensive.</p>

        <p>900.2. The casual variants detailed here use supplemental zones, rules, cards, and other game implements not
          used in traditional Magic games.</p>

        <h2 id="901">
          901. Planechase
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>901.1. In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to
          the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.</p>

        <p>901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the
          Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence
          option. See rule 806, âFree-for-All Variant.â</p>

        <p>901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a planar deck of at least ten plane and/or
          phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon
          cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 309, âPlanes,â and rule 310,
          âPhenomena.â)</p>

        <p>901.3a A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol {PW}. One face has the chaos
          symbol {CHAOS}. The other faces are blank.</p>

        <p>901.4. At the start of the game, each player shuffles their planar deck so that the cards are in a random
          order. Each deck is placed face down next to its ownerâs library. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the
          command zone throughout the game, both while theyâre part of a planar deck and while theyâre face up.</p>

        <p>901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take
          an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar
          deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If itâs a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the
          bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule 103.6.)
          No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes
          the starting plane.</p>

        <p>901.6. The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar
          deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller.
          Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller
          would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldnât leave the game becomes the planar
          controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation
          until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.</p>

        <p>901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone.
          The cardâs static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities
          may be activated.</p>

        <p>901.7a A face-up plane card or phenomenon card thatâs turned face down becomes a new object.</p>

        <p>901.8. Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the âplaneswalking ability.â The full
          text of this ability is âWhenever you roll {PW}, planeswalk.â (See rule 701.24, âPlaneswalk.â) This ability
          has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception
          to rule 113.8.</p>

        <p>901.9. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their
          turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the
          number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesnât use
          the stack. Note that this number wonât be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die
          that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule 116.2h.)</p>

        <p>901.9a If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.</p>

        <p>901.9b If the die roll is the chaos symbol {CHAOS}, any ability of a face-up plane that starts âWhen you roll
          {CHAOS}â triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority.</p>

        <p>901.9c If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol {PW}, the âplaneswalking abilityâ triggers and is put on
          the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule 901.8.)</p>

        <p>901.10. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave
          the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller
          turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the
          player leaves the game.</p>

        <p>901.10a If a plane leaves the game while a âplaneswalking abilityâ is on the stack, that ability ceases to
          exist.</p>

        <p>901.10b Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the
          new planar controller.</p>

        <p>901.11. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck
          and turns it face up, that player has âplaneswalked.â Continuous effects with durations that last until a
          player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule 701.24.</p>

        <p>901.11a A player may planeswalk as the result of the âplaneswalking abilityâ (see rule 901.8), because the
          owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenonâs
          triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.</p>

        <p>901.11b The plane card thatâs turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or
          phenomenon card thatâs turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player
          planeswalks away from.</p>

        <p>901.11c If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away
          from all such planes.</p>

        <p>901.12. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant
          and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.</p>

        <p>901.12a Each player has their own planar deck.</p>

        <p>901.12b The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current
          planar controllerâs team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that
          wouldnât leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controllerâs team leaves the game.
          The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the
          active team, whichever comes first.</p>

        <p>901.12c Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that
          plane or phenomenon that refers to âyouâ applies to both members of the planar controllerâs team.</p>

        <p>901.12d Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each
          playerâs cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled
          the planar die that turn.</p>

        <p>901.13. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the
          limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable
          objects and players in the game. (See rule 801, âLimited Range of Influence Option.â)</p>

        <p>901.14. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same
          time.</p>

        <p>901.14a Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker
          sets a starting plane (see rule 901.5). Each of them is a planar controller.</p>

        <p>901.14b If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn
          markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar
          controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player
          controlled is put on the bottom of its ownerâs planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.</p>

        <h3>
          <p>901.15. Single Planar Deck Option</p>
        </h3>

        <p>901.15a As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In
          that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of
          players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck canât contain more phenomenon cards than twice the
          number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.</p>

        <p>901.15b In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be
          the owner of all cards in the planar deck.</p>

        <p>901.15c If any rule or ability refers to a playerâs planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.</p>

        <h2 id="902">
          902. Vanguard
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>902.1. In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character.
          Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The
          Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.</p>

        <p>902.2. A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.</p>

        <p>902.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is
          placed face up next to its ownerâs library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command
          zone throughout the game.</p>

        <p>902.4. Each playerâs starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.</p>
        <p>Example: The life modifier of a playerâs vanguard card is -3. That playerâs starting life total is 17.</p>

        <p>902.5. Each playerâs starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard
          card.</p>

        <p>902.5a If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a normal game, that player shuffles
          their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand equal to their starting hand size. (In a multiplayer
          game, a playerâs first mulligan is for the same number of cards as they had before.) See rule 103.4.</p>
        <p>Example: The hand modifier of a playerâs vanguard card is +2. That player starts the game with a hand of 9
          cards. If the player takes a mulligan three times before keeping, they draw a new hand of nine cards and put
          three of those on the bottom of their library.</p>

        <p>902.5b A playerâs maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.</p>
        <p>Example: The hand modifier of a playerâs vanguard card is -1. That playerâs maximum hand size is six. If that
          player has more than six cards in their hand as their cleanup step begins, they will discard all but six of
          them.</p>

        <p>902.6. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The
          controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.</p>

        <p>902.7. Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone function from that zone. The cardâs
          static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be
          activated.</p>

          903. Commander
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>903.1. In the Commander variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deckâs
          commander. The Commander variant was created and popularized by fans; an independent rules committee maintains
          additional resources at MTGCommander.net. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game,
          with the following additions.</p>

        <p>903.2. A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the
          Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence
          option. See rule 806, âFree-for-All Variant.â</p>

        <p>903.3. Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its commander. This designation is not a
          characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card
          retains this designation even when it changes zones.</p>
        <p>Example: A commander thatâs been turned face down (due to Ixidronâs effect, for example) is still a
          commander. A commander thatâs copying another card (due to Cytoshapeâs effect, for example) is still a
          commander. A permanent thatâs copying a commander (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a commander in
          a playerâs graveyard) is not a commander.</p>

        <p>903.3a Some planeswalker cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability
          modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. See also rule 113.6m.</p>

        <p>903.3b If a playerâs commander is a meld card and itâs melded with the other member of its meld pair, the
          resulting melded permanent is that playerâs commander.</p>

        <p>903.3c If a playerâs commander is a component of a merged permanent, the resulting merged permanent is that
          playerâs commander.</p>

        <p>903.3d If an effect refers to controlling a commander, it refers to a permanent on the battlefield that is a
          commander. If an effect refers to casting a commander, it refers to a spell that is a commander. If an effect
          refers to a commander in a specific zone, it refers to a card in that zone that is a commander.</p>

        <p>903.4. The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain
          commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that cardâs mana cost or
          rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule 604.3) or color
          indicator (see rule 204).</p>
        <p>Example: Bosh, Iron Golem is a legendary artifact creature with mana cost {8} and the ability â{3}{R},
          Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh, Iron Golem deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifactâs converted mana cost to
          any target.â Boshâs color identity is red.</p>

        <p>903.4a Color identity is established before the game begins.</p>

        <p>903.4b Reminder text is ignored when determining a cardâs color identity. See rule 207.2.</p>

        <p>903.4c The back face of a double-faced card (see rule 711) is included when determining a cardâs color
          identity. This is an exception to rule 711.4a.</p>
        <p>Example: Civilized Scholar is the front face of a double-faced card with mana cost {2}{U}. Homicidal Brute is
          the back face of that double-faced card and has a red color indicator. The cardâs color identity is blue and
          red.</p>

        <p>903.5. Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.</p>

        <p>903.5a Each deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck
          size and the maximum deck size are both 100.</p>

        <p>903.5b Other than basic lands, each card in a Commander deck must have a different English name.</p>

        <p>903.5c A card can be included in a Commander deck only if every color in its color identity is also found in
          the color identity of the deckâs commander.</p>
        <p>Example: Wort, the Raidmother is a legendary creature with mana cost {4}{R/G}{R/G}. Wortâs color identity is
          red and green. Each card in a Wort Commander deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no
          color. Each mana symbol in the mana cost or rules text of a card in this deck must be only red, only green,
          both red and green, or have no color.</p>

        <p>903.5d A card with a basic land type may be included in a Commander deck only if each color of mana it could
          produce is included in the commanderâs color identity.</p>
        <p>Example: Wort, the Raidmotherâs color identity is red and green. A Wort Commander deck may include land cards
          with the basic land types Mountain and/or Forest. It canât include any land cards with the basic land types
          Plains, Island, or Swamp.</p>

        <p>903.6. At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command
          zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining 99 cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order.
          Those cards become the playerâs library.</p>

        <p>903.7. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand
          of seven cards.</p>

        <p>903.8. A player may cast a commander they own from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone
          costs an additional {2} for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that
          game. This additional cost is informally known as the âcommander tax.â</p>

        <p>903.9. A commander may return to the command zone during a Commander game.</p>

        <p>903.9a If a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that card was put into that zone since the last time
          state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. This is a state-based action.
          See rule 704.</p>

        <p>903.9b If a commander would be put into its ownerâs hand or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into
          the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an
          exception to rule 614.5.</p>

        <p>903.9c If a commander is a melded permanent or a merged permanent and its owner chooses to put it into the
          command zone using the replacement effect described in rule 903.9b, that permanent and each component
          representing it that isnât a commander are put into the appropriate zone, and the card that represents it and
          is a commander is put into the command zone.</p>

        <p>903.10. The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other
          rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)</p>

        <p>903.10a A player thatâs been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game
          loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)</p>

        <p>903.11. If a player is allowed to bring a card from outside the game into a Commander game, that player canât
          bring a card into the game this way if it has the same name as a card that player had in their starting deck,
          if it has the same name as a card that the player has already brought into the game, or if any color in its
          color identity isnât in the color identity of the playerâs commander.</p>

        <h3>
          <p>903.12. Brawl Option</p>
        </h3>

        <p>903.12a Brawl is an option for a different style of Commander game. Brawl games use the normal rules for the
          Commander variant with the following modifications.</p>

        <p>903.12b Brawl decks are usually constructed using cards from the Standard format.</p>

        <p>903.12c A player designates either a legendary planeswalker or a legendary creature as their commander.</p>

        <p>903.12d A playerâs deck must contain exactly 60 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum
          deck size and the maximum deck size are both 60.</p>

        <p>903.12e If a playerâs commander has no colors in its color identity, that playerâs deck may contain any
          number of basic lands of one basic land type of their choice. This is an exception to rule 903.5d.</p>

        <p>903.12f In a two-player Brawl game, each playerâs starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game,
          each playerâs starting life total is 30.</p>

        <p>903.12g In any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesnât count toward the number of cards that
          player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent
          mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>

        <p>903.12h Brawl games do not use the state-based action described in rule 704.6c, which causes a player to lose
          the game if theyâve been dealt 21 or more combat damage by a commander.</p>

        <h2 id="904">
          904. Archenemy
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>904.1. In the Archenemy variant, a team of players faces off against a single opponent strengthened with
          powerful scheme cards. The Archenemy variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following
          additions.</p>

        <p>904.2. The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule 808)
          involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) and the shared team turns
          option (see rule 805) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.</p>

        <p>904.2a One of the teams consists of exactly one player, who is designated the archenemy.</p>

        <p>904.2b The other team consists of any number of players.</p>

        <p>904.3. In addition to the normal game materials, the archenemy needs a scheme deck of at least twenty scheme
          cards. A scheme deck may contain no more than two of any card with a particular English name. (See rule 312,
          âSchemes.â)</p>

        <p>904.4. At the start of the game, the archenemy shuffles their scheme deck so that the cards are in a random
          order. The scheme deck is placed face down next to the archenemyâs library. All scheme cards remain in the
          command zone throughout the game, both while theyâre part of a scheme deck and while theyâre face up.</p>

        <p>904.5. The archenemyâs starting life total is 40. Each other playerâs starting life total is 20.</p>

        <p>904.6. Rather than a randomly determined player, the archenemy takes the first turn of the game.</p>

        <p>904.7. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The
          controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.</p>

        <p>904.8. Any abilities of a face-up scheme card in the command zone function from that zone. The cardâs static
          abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
        </p>

        <p>904.9. Immediately after the archenemyâs precombat main phase begins during each of their turns, that player
          moves the top card of their scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called âsetting
          that scheme in motion.â (See rule 701.25.) This turn-based action doesnât use the stack. Abilities of that
          scheme card that trigger âWhen you set this scheme in motionâ trigger.</p>

        <p>904.10. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme
          are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom
          of its ownerâs scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See
          rule 704.)</p>

        <p>904.11. Once an ongoing scheme card is set in motion, it remains face up in the command zone until an ability
          causes it to be abandoned (see rule 701.26).</p>

        <p>904.12. Supervillain Rumble Option</p>

        <p>904.12a As an alternative option, players may play a Free-for-All game in which each player has their own
          scheme deck. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) is used; no other multiplayer options are used.
        </p>

        <p>904.12b Each player in this game is an archenemy.</p>

        <p>904.12c As in a normal Free-for-All game, the starting player is randomly determined. All other rules that
          apply to the archenemy in an Archenemy game apply to each player in a Supervillain Rumble game.</p>

        <h2 id="905">905. Conspiracy Draft</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>905.1. The Conspiracy Draft variant consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards
          from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Conspiracy Draft variant
          uses Magic: The GatheringâConspiracyâ¢ and/or Conspiracy: Take the Crownâ¢ booster packs by default.</p>

        <p>905.1a A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster
          pack, drafts one card by placing that card in a face-down pile in front of the player, then passes the
          remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts a card from the booster pack passed to them and
          passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.
        </p>

        <p>905.1b In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each playerâs left. In the second
          draft round, booster packs are passed to each playerâs right.</p>

        <p>905.1c During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting
          from, cards they have already drafted, cards that are currently revealed as described in rule 905.2b, and
          cards that have been drafted face up as described in rule 905.2c. A player may not reveal drafted cards to
          other players unless an ability instructs them to.</p>

        <p>905.1d After the draft and all actions that may be taken during or after the draft, all the cards a player
          has drafted become that playerâs card pool. The player builds their deck from only these cards and any number
          of basic land cards. See rules 100.2b and 100.4b.</p>

        <p>905.2. Some cards have abilities that function during the draft.</p>

        <p>905.2a During a draft, there is no active player or system of priority. If multiple players wish to take an
          action at the same time during the draft and canât agree on an order, those actions are taken in a random
          order.</p>

        <p>905.2b Some cards instruct players to reveal them as theyâre drafted and then note some information, such as
          a number or color. This information can be referred to by other abilities during the game. Any player can look
          at this information at any time during the draft or game. After the information is noted, the drafted card is
          turned face down and added to the playerâs drafted cards pile.</p>

        <p>905.2c Some cards instruct players to draft them face up. Each such card remains face up until the draft is
          complete, an effect instructs the person who drafted it to turn it face down, or the card leaves that playerâs
          drafted cards pile. While the card is face up, all players may look at it.</p>

        <p>905.3. A Conspiracy Draft game is a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All
          variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule
          806, âFree-for-All Variant.â</p>

        <p>905.4. At the start of the game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy
          cards from their sideboard into the command zone.</p>

        <p>905.4a Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. Any time a player has
          priority, they may turn a face-down conspiracy card they control face up. See rule 702.105, âHidden Agenda.â
        </p>

        <p>905.5. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the
          game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.</p>

        <p>905.6. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 20 and draws a hand
          of seven cards.</p>
